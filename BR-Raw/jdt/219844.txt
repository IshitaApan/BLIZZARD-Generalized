[implementation] F2 (Show Tooltip Description) does not work in active editor after restart

I20080220-1400, as seen in today's stand-up demo - open a Java Editor - restart workbench - F2 does not work Problem is that JavaInformationProvider.update() silently fails when active page is not available (which apparently happens during startup). Furthermore, the 'fCurrentPerspective != perspectiveId' there is wrong. I also fail to see why a new JavaTypeHover must be created for *all* Java editors on the first partActivated or partBroughtToTop event that happens after (not during!) a perspective switch.
