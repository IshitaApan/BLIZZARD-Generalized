[JUnit] Open failed test failed when test name is "1.3 - test346"

Using org.eclipse.jdt.junit version 20031021, I got a failure when I tried to open a failed test that is named "1.3 - test346". This can happen with the compiler tests when they run in 1.3 mode. We add "1.3", "1.4" or "1.5" to distinguish the different compiler compliance mode. I attach a patch for the opening action that fixes the issue.
