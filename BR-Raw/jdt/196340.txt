[override method] Can OverrideMethodsAction.createRunnable make available 'save compilation unit' to users who want to save the file

Build ID: Eclipse 3.2 Steps To Reproduce: Can OverrideMethodsAction.createRunnable make available 'save compilation unit' to users who want to save the file Currently we see that OverrideMethodsAction.createRunnable sets save=false in the AddUnimplementedMethodsOperation constructor There is no way to save the contents of the class after the operation runs, I think this is a bug/unnecessary limitation, After the operation runs, it does not save the contents in the file so it appears as if the operation did not work. Right now I have 2 ways to get it to work 1. Use OverrideMethods... Then I can get that code to work is to have the file open in a editor, run the runnable/operation that dirties the file, and call IWorkbenchPage.saveEditor(IEditorPart, false); This solution is hacky. 2. Or use AddUnimplemented.... directly, that means I am using internal API More information:
