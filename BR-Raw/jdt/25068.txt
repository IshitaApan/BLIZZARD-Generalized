Reuse editor in Search view causes the menubar to refresh a lot.

Build 20021017 Reuse editor does not flash the menus on the debug but flashs a lot in the search view. >> Steps to see it working in the debugger: Create two classes (A and B) with main methods. Implement the main() in A calling the main in B and vice versa. Put a breakpoing in one of them and run it. Close all editors in the debugger. Make sure if you the settings in the debug preferences to reuse editors. Press F5 to go from A to B and vice versa. The menu bar stays the same. >> Steps to reproduce the problem in the seach view. Do a search to finds two items from 2 java files. Close all editors. Make sure the reuse editors preference is set. Click in one item and then the other and see how the menu bar flashs. My guess is that the search is closing and reopening the editor instead of reusing it.
