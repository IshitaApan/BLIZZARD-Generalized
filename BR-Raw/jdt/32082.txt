Creation of { } block captures first line

When creating an 'if' or 'for' block, the first line is always captured in the block. I believe this to be a fairly major bug, since it is very possible that when you are writing code you want to insert an if/for/while test into existing code, and definately /not/ end up accidentally capturing a statement. It may have been added in as an idea of productivity recently (don't recall seeing this in 2.1M3 or 4) but it really does not work. 2.1M5 Mac OS X 10.2.4 System.out.println("Before if"); System.out.println("After if"); -> System.out.println("Before if"); if (test) System.out.println("After if"); -> System.out.println("Before if"); if (test) { System.out.println("After if"); } I am reporting this as a major bug; I can't quite feel that it should be a critical bug. However, I do think it should be fixed in 2.1 rather than leaving it, because otherwise people are going to introduce a /lot/ of unneccessary coding errors without realising what is going on.
