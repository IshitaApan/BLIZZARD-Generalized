Primary working copy: No updates when changed in working copy mode

20030918 see test cases TypeHierarchyTest.testHierarchyWithWorkingCopy1, TypeHierarchyTest.testHierarchyWithWorkingCopy2, TypeHierarchyTest.testHierarchyWithWorkingCopy3 A hierarchy is created on a type that is then opened in an editor. The super type is modified, the editor saved: The type hierarchy does not send a 'typeHierarchyChanged' notification. If I understood correctly, the 'typeHierarchyChanged' is supposed to notify only on save, not while editing the working copy. Crrently it doesn't notify at all.
