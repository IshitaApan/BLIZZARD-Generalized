[common navigator] newly created project disappears in Project Explorer

It looks like bug 208462 regressed in the official Ganymede release. I have been trying to catch it with the shortest possible steps to reproduce and I have a nice success today. 1. Install the Eclipse for RCP developers. 2. Start Eclipse, choose workspace. 3. Open the Resource perspective. 4. Call the New Java project wizard. 5. Enter 'a' for project name. 6. Click the Next button. Project 'a' is created and appears in the Project Explorer view. OK 7. Click the Back button. The creation of project 'a' is reverted and disappears from the Project Explorer. OK 8. Click the Next button again. Project 'a' is created and appears in the Project Explorer, but shortly (less than a second) later disappears. PROBLEM You may need repeat steps 6-7 one or more times, but at the end you will reproduce the problem.
