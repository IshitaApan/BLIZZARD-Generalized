Open type list - no longer works if ever cancelled during indexing

Build 205 Attempting to patch a binary project. I manually expanded its sources in a source folder, and then force a refresh from local. Then immediatly, I tried to open the type I wanted to patch, I got a dialog indicating that indexing was still in progress. I then cancelled my action (open type), and got a "No types available". Tried again later. The dialog came up again with "No types available", even though indexing was finished by then. It seems to have cached the empty list, and I remember this bug around 0.9.
