Cannot "Generate Delegate Methods..."

I have this snippet and I would expect that I may create delegate methods for the member. However no methods of the member are presented for choice. Tested with 3.1M5a. ----- public class DelegateException { 	Exception _exception; 	 	public DelegateException(Exception exception) { 		_exception = exception; 	} }
