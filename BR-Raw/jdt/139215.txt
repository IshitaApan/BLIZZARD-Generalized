[5.0][syntax highlighting] "</code>" after @ not rendered correctly in Javadoc

3.2 RC2 candidate The <code>@BeforeClass</code> comment in the Javadoc below is not correctly rendered: /** * A <code>Failure</code> holds a description of the failed test and the * exception that was thrown while running it. In most cases the <code>Description</code> * will be of a single test. However, if problems are encountered while constructing the * test (for example, if a <code>@BeforeClass</code> method is not static), it may describe * something other than a single test. */ Seems like the @something is causing troubles
