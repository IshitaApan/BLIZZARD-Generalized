[content assist] Remove final modifier from several JavaCompletionProposal subclasses

To make subwords completion work for almost all standard completions, I had to copy the following classes because they have a final modifier: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.FilledArgumentNamesMethodProposal org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.LazyGenericTypeProposal org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ParameterGuessingProposal Is is possible to remove the final modifier from these classes? It would be nice if this change can make it into Juno release; it would make our codebase a bit cleaner for 3.9.
