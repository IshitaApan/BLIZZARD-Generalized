Bogus error messages

1. Create a Project Test with a folder "COM". 2. Create a Project Test2 with a folder "com". 3. Select "COM" from Step 1, copy it to Test2. You get an error dialog: An error occurred while copying resources. Reason: Status <==== bogus, what does "Status" mean? 4. Same thing happens if you try to a folder with the same name AND the error dialog has the incorrect action information (the dialog is titled "Copy" instead of "Move" and its error message says error "copying", not "moving").
