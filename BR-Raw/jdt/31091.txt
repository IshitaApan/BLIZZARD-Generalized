14 times - Unneccessary error dialog from Outline View

I20030205 1) Open a java file that is not on the classpath (in SWT we have many of these because the code for other platforms is not included in the current classpath). For example, get org.eclipse.swt from CVS and copy .classpath_carbon to .classpath. Now open org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/gtk/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.java. 2) Click on a method in the Outline view. 14 times a dialog pops up with title "Operation can not be performed" and message "The resource is not on the build path of a project.". After the last dialog is closed, the Java editor scrolls to the requested method.
