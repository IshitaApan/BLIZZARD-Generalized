[refactoring] Preview filter combo: selecting an item does not update preview

N20051208-0010 Choosing an item from the refactoring preview 'Filter Changes' combo does not update the textual preview (i.e., the old change is still shown and the new filter only takes effect when the user selects something in the change tree). See also bug 120268.
