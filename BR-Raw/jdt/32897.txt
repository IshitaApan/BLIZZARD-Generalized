Cannot configure Javadoc referenced classes

In the second step of the Generate Javadoc wizard, I should be able to configure referenced classes. For example, JUnit is listed in the listbox. If I try to configure it and enter a URL for it (which is correctly validated), the OK button of that dialog does not work; only the cancel button does!
