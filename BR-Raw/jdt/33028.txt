hang in clipboard get contents [reorg] [ccp] [dnd]

All the 2.1 GTK builds of the last few months seem to hang/deadlock some of the time. This is on a Redhat 7.3 system with updates GTK 2.0 to the latest version. The problem seems to occur especially when Eclipse is not used for some time or when opening a file or doing a CVS update.
