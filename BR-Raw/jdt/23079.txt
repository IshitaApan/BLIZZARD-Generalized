JavaElementLabels does not honor P_COMPRESSED for types and members

Build 20020903 The label provider has an option to compress the package name (P_COMPRESSED). This option is not applied to types and members. Test Case: 1. Enable package fragment name compression 2. Search for declarations of a type or method which is not in the default package ==> the Search view should honor the package fragment name compression
