Migration to new source lookup facilities [JUnit]

New source lookup facilities have been added to the debug platform. The Java debugger provides a corresponding new implementation for source lookup. The following patch will migrate the JUnit launch config to use the new source lookup support. The changes are: * specify the platform source lookup tab in the tab group * no longer initialize the source locator attribute in launch shortcuts * specify the source locator and source path computer for the JUnit launch config type in plug-in XML
