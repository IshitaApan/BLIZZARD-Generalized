[implementation][content assist] Broken extension point XSD and UI: proposalSorter is missing activate attribute

Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Add javaCompletionProposalSorters extension point 2. Add proposalSorter 3. Implement your proposal sorter 4. Test sorter: Open preferences and choose your sorter (Java->Editor->Content Assist->Sort proposals) 5. Even though it is chosen, your sorter will not execute and you can see NPE in log: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ProposalSorterHandle.sortProposals(ProposalSorterHandle.java:191) More information: The reason why it doesn't work is that ProposalSorterHandle instance has "activate" field set to false. To fix this, you must manually edit your plugin.xml and add activate="true" attribute to proposalSorter element. XSD should be enhanced to contain 'activate' attribute and UI should be enhanced to offer activate combo with true/false as other extensions do (e.g. javaCompletionProposalComputer).
