Argument hover doesn't work for nested method calls

- enter the following code public class A { 	public int foo(int x, int y) { 		return 1; 	} 	 	public void bar() { 	} } - now enter public void bar() { foo<= code assist } - select foo(int x, int y) - observe: argument hover is correct - now type foo again - open code assist - select foo(...) - type 10, 10 and cursor left - argument hover disappears although outer method call isn't finihed yet.
