[content assist] prefix complete casted method proposals

Created attachment 112697 assist_diff.txt Taken from bug 208540: - enable incremental completion - invoke content assist after ( | = caret): ---------------------------------- void m(Object o) { if (o instanceof Integer) o.g| ---------------------------------- - expected: prefix completed to "o.get", proposals for getClass and getInteger methods - actual: no prefix completion, the proposal selector opens directly -- Also, the fix for #208540 added a small change when compared to 3.3 to the "semi case sensitive" matching done by prefix completion: - enable incremental completion - invoke content assist after ( | = caret): ---------------------------------- void m(int indexCount) { ind| ---------------------------------- - expected: incremental completion detects the sole case sensitve match for the 'indexCount' parameter and applies the proposal (3.3 behavior) - actual: the proposal selector opens and shows all kinds of types like IndexOutOfBoundsException The case matching algorithm is arguably peculiar - but the case outlined above bugs me frequently. The attached patch fixes the two problems described and adds tests, also for #208540. The patch restores one part of the previous fix for #208540 and overwrites getPrefixCompletionStart in JavaMethodCompletionProposal for METHOD_REF_WITH_CASTED_RECEIVER proposals.
