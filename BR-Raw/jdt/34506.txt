[wording] Confusing warning with package creation "Package will not be visible..."

In the New Package wizard, 1. create a package test.something 2. again do New Package, type in "test" At the top of the wizard it informs you "Note: Package will not be visible in Package Explorer while empty." I don't understand what its trying to tell me. Perhaps its outdated now that we have all the filtering rules that can be turned on/off? In my specific case I had all filtering rules turned off and indeed the empty package in question would be visible. Its odd too that it only informs you for that case. If instead you simply create an empty package (as in step 1) it won't warn you. Finally, it mentions specifically the Package Explorer yet there are other views that I assume this could apply to (whatever it is its warning me about).
