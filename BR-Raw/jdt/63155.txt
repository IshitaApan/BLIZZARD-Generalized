[Refactoring] no user feedback when error during implicit refactoring triggered by drag'n'drop

I200405190010 Linux-GTK It looks like, that if a error is thrown in the createChange() method of a participant, during a refactoring generated by a drag'n'drop, the error is not reported to the user. My test case is : 1. add a breakpoint in a JSP file (there is a bug in the Java breakpoint participants for 'non-standard' breakpoints, bug 62932). 2. move a compilation using drag'n'drop, a progress dialog appears, then disappears. Nothing changed in the workspace. 3. try to do the same refactoring by using refactoring>move from the context menu of the compilation unit. An error dialog appears, a stack trace is added to the log file.
