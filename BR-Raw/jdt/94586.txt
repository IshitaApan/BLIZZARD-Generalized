[code manipulation] Overriding methods and delegates should have separate comment and code templates

It would be extremely helpful if overriding methods and delegates would have separate comment and code templates. Each of these cases needs a different comment, and also the needs for the method body are different. E.g. an overriding method needs a TODO-comment, while in a delegate, it will be a pain in the neck to manually delete each of these TODO-comments.
