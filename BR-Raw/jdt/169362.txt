[key binding] Ctrl+O during code assist disables key bindings

Build ID: I20060810-1230 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Open some existing Java file in a Java editor, and trigger an autocomplete popup, for example, by typing "return get", and pressing CTRL-SPACE, to see a list of getters. 2. While the pop-up is still being displayed, press CTRL-O to attempt to open the quick-outline. The quick-outline does not actually show up. 3. Dismiss the autocomplete popup by clicking somewhere else. 4. Try the shortcuts CTRL-O for quickoutline, CTRL-SHIFT-F to format the code, etc. They will no longer work. 5. Close and reopen the Java file (doesn't matter whether you save the changes). The shortcut keys CTRL-O and CTRL-SHIFT-F will work again. More information:
