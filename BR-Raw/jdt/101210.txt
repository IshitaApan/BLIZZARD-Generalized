Change method signature is disabled after disallowed call

In N20050622-0010. Code: import junit.framework.TestCase; public class NewTest extends TestCase { 	protected void setUp() throws Exception { 	} } 1) Select setUp, choose Refactor > Change Method Signature. 2) You are told that setUp overrides a method in TestCase. Say 'Yes'. 3) You are told "Cannot perform operation". Say 'OK'. Try again to activate Change Method Signature. The menu item is grayed out! The action is disabled, and the key combo is also ineffective. Change Method Signature can not be used in this editor (other editors are unaffected). Now, use Alt+Shift+T for the quick menu, and select Change Method Signature. The action is reenabled for all use cases. This occurs no matter how Change Method Signature is invoked in step 1: menu bar, quick menu, or key combo.
