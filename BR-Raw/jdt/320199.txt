[preferences] UserLibraryPreferencePage Edit/Remove do not work as expected when same jar is contained in 2 or more libs

Created attachment 174583 Patch I20100713-0800 Steps : 1) Go to UserLibraryPreferencePage, add a new lib and a jar under it (A -> x.jar) 2) Add another lib and same jar (B -> x.jar) 3) Edit one of the attributes in the second jar B -> x.jar => The value shows up in A-> x.jar . Same problem with Remove as well. Attaching a patch. We should refresh the parent container always since that uniquely identifies the list elements and the attributes and refreshes the appropriate element and not the first occurrence of the element in the tree.
