[typing] Copy Line (Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow) fails on last line of editor

The command "Copy Line" which is bound to Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow by default fails when you're on the last line of a file/editor. 1) Create new text file. 2) Enter text: "Blah blah blah blah" (no newline) 3) Press Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow (note UpArrow also fails) Nothing happens. If you press enter after #2, and then try, it works. Ctrl+Alt+DownArrow should knoww to create a new line at the end of the buffer if it's at the last line of the editor. This effects the text editor, as well as the Java editor (and probably all others based on the text editor.
