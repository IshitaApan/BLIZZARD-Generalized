Improve LeakTestCase performance by checking multiple classes

HEAD LeakTestCase performance is very bad if tests assert the instance count of multiple classes in sequence (e.g. TextViewerUndoManagerLeakTest.testLeak()). LeakTestCase.assertInstanceCount(Class, int) should be expanded to allow checking instance counts for more than one classes at once during the same memory traversal.
