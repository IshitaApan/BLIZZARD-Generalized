Importing folder into itself causes "infinite" recursion [ccp]

build 20020806 -In the Windows explorer copy a workspace folder to the clipbaord (using context menu->Copy) -In the Eclipse package explorer select the parent of the folder in the same workspace -Paste the folder into the workspace ->The operation starts and eventually fails, leaving lots of sub folders in the workspace. Drag and drop import has the same problem. The copy/paste side of the problem is in the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation of the workbench. Opened bug 22444 for that. I'm going to release a fix in a few days, when I'm done with refactoring and other cleanup. I suggest that you use the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation for drag and drop import as well. I'm in the process of changing the Navigator dnd import (which was the only import that guarded against this) to use the CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation.
