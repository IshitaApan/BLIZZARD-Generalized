[preferences][templates] importing template preferences does not update the template store

RC1 Importing preferences may change the custom (code) templates. However, the TemplateStore instance storing the templates for the Java editor does not update itself. Steps to reproduce: - import a preferences file with custom template for the file comment - create a new class -> the old file comment is used Solution is to create a IPropertyChangeListener in JavaPlugin and reload the (Code)TemplateStore upon a preference change.
