[save actions] Format edited lines on save takes ages with many changed lines

I20071030-0010 - open StyledText.java - enable format on save (edited lines) - replace all " =" with "=" - save => takes multiple minutes, not cancellable, no progress => expected: a) is quicker b) shows cancellable progress after at most 5 seconds (in dialog or in workbench window trim)
