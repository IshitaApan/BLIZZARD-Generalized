close/open project: incorrect compile order

eclipse-SDK-20020612 ibm jdk1.3.1 I closed 20 projects in the java perspective, choosing the projects from the package view. The 20 projects I closed were org.eclipse.swt.* and org.eclipse.jdt.* I closed all 20 projects simultaneously using the project>close menu. I then re-openned all 20 projects simultaneously using the project>open menu pull down. When I perform this operation I generage over 40,000 compile errors. It appears the projects are being re-openned one at a time, not in compile order. I would expect the open project to perform the operation as a group, in compile order. I repeated the same experiment in the java perspective using the navigator view and everything behaved correctly. In addition the behaviour in the resource perspective using the navigator view was also correct. Finally I tried the package view in the resource perspective and observed the same behaviour as that in the java perspective (40,000 compile errors). A rebuild in both error cases clears all compile errors
