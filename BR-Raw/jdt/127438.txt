junit view: fast view icon shows "completed" state when view is shown

I20060213-0010 - junit view as fast view, not showing - run some tests > the icon on the fast view bar shows progress as test are run - click on the icon to show the fast view < expected: the icon stays as it is or shows the Junit view icon > actual: the icon shows the check mark for "completed" tests
