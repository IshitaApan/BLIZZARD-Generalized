[working sets] Check out into new working set results into strange working set

3.5 but not 3.4.x. Not directly a regression because in 3.4.x it was not possible to create a working set in the Check Out dialog. Steps to reproduce: 0. start new workspace 1. select project 'org.eclipse.core.expressions' in the CVS Repositories view 2. context menu > Check Out As... 3. in the dialog choose to add project to a Java working set (create it now) 5. click 'Finish' 6. open the Project Explorer 7. in the Project Explorer select 'Working Sets' as 'Top Level Element' 8. select the working set from step 3 9. expand the working set ==> two nodes one being a org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolder resulting in label error. Step 3 where the new working set is created is the culprit: it has the remote project/folder preselected.
