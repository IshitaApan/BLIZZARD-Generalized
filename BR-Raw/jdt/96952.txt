[build path] project settings: library tab enablement and focus

3.1-RC1 test pass (spawned from bug 96048) - project settings, library tab - have a library without javadoc location - press edit, add a URL, e.g. http://www.example.org > note that afterwards, the 'Remove' button is disabled. It only gets enabled for the javadoc location if I move the selection and back. > the same applies for the source attachment
