[typing] correct indentation fails for indented braces

3.1 M2 from bug 44961: My brace style in the code formatter is set to the 'Whitesmiths' style which indents curly braces to the level of the code that they surround. Like so: if (condition) { // do something! } In Eclipse 3.0.1, when typing the braces for the 'if' the braces would appear indented as above. But in Eclipse 3.1M2, the braces always move back to the level of the 'if'. Like so: if (condition) { // do something! } I've noticed that the same thing happens for for loops while loops, else blocks, try blocks, catch blocks, and switch blocks (although the try, catch and switch blocks weren't working in 3.0.1). I know that my formatting settings are correct because everything looks fine when I invoke the code formatter.
