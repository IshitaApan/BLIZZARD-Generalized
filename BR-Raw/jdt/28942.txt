"Extract method" refactoring error [refactoring]

When using the "extract method" refactoring, there seems to be a bug with the return statements if the return type is void. When extracting the following code for example: if (error == true) return; doSomething(); He complaints that not all execution paths contain a return statement. This is not necessary as the return type is void.
