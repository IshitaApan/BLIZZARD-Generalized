Compiler option changes not handled correctly (1GKWRI3)

Nothing happens if auto-build is on and (some) compiler options are 	changed . 	If something was reported as error and now I choose that to be 	reported as warning and if autobuild is on I expect a 	rebuild. 	Same if I switch from 1.2 to 1.3 compatibilty. NOTES: EG (01.10.2001 14:57:06) 	we should prompt the user for a rebuild whenever an option changes. MA (01.10.2001 15:16:25) 	The description in the pages says everything. EG (02.10.2001 18:16:59) 	yes, but this is isn't sufficient. We should show a dialog with the 	option to rebuild the workspace after apply.
