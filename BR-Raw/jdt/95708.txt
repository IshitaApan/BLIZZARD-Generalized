[nls tooling] Wizard for Eclipse NLS doesn't handle duplicated keys

M7 1. with the new NLS scheme (fields), translate the following file and give both fields the same key "hello_key", First problem: Messages file gets duplicated key: Remove the dup key. 2. Open the NLS wizard again, change the second key to "hello_key2" Second problem: A new key-value pair is added to the properties file, but no new field is created. class A { String lab1= "Hello"; String lab2= "Hello"; }
