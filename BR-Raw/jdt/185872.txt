[introduce parameter object] Introduce Parameter Object cannot create nested class if top-level type with the same name exists

3.3M7 I20070503-1400 1. Have two source files X.java and Y.java. 2. Perform the Introduce Parameter Object refactoring to a method in X. Choose to create a nested class and call it Y. 3. The refactoring cannot proceed as the dialogue sees a clash between the existing Y and the proposed X.Y. The dialogue should only block an attempt to create the top-level Y, not the nested X.Y (providing that the rest of the code can be refactored so that 'Y' refers to the intended class). The dialogue could warn about the similar name though.
