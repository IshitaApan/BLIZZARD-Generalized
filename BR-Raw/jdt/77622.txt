I200411022000 Using the following 2 CUs: package test; import static test1.B.PI; public class A { 	public void foo() { 		double pi= PI; 	} } package test1; public class B { 	public static final double PI= Math.PI; } when renaming the field PI (from decl. and ref.) 2 problems in the refactored source are reported in the dialog before the refactoring is applied.
