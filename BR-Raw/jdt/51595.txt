[rulers] annotation roll-over: selecting "quick fix" from context menu does not work any longer

M7 Testpass on I200402102000 1. Enable the annotation roll over 2. Open TestCase.java 3. Try to invoke quick fix using the ruler context menu on a warning -> nothing happens -> the roll over hover does its own action invocation thing (see createCompositeRuler in JavaEditor).
