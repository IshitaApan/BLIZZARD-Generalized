Paste in Packages does not accept files on the clipboard

I created a FileTransfer in another view that contains file paths and placed it on the clipboard using SWT DND Clipboard object. Resource navigator recognized this and allowed me to paste the files into the project, but Packages 'Paste' didn't.
