[ltk] problems overriding TextFileChange#commit() [refactoring]

The implementation of TextFileChange.commit() may not actually perform the commit: 		if (needsSaving()) { 			fBuffer.commit(pm, false); 		} If I override the method, I cannot use the same condition, as needsSaving() is private. Even if I rely on the TextFileChange.commit() by calling super.commit() I then do not know if the commit was actually performed. I suggest to move the if-statement to the method perform(), such that commit() is called when it is supposed to be performed, only.
