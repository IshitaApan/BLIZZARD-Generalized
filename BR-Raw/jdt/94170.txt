Javadoc links in help view don't navigate directly to specific anchors in HTML

Using M6 on WinXP, and using default help settings, clicking Javadoc links in the help view cause the correct Javadoc page to be displayed, but the help view won't navigate to the correct anchor point in the Javadoc HTML--the page loads but won't scroll to the correct location in the docs for the particular field/method one has requested Javadocs for...you're left at the top of the page. However, right-clicking the Javdoc link in the help view and choosing "Open in Help Contents" (as opposed to the default "Open") will open the Javadoc in an external browser which will navigate to the correct location on the correct page. Right-clicking in the Javadoc page and choosing "Properties" does show a complete URL including the "#methodName(param list)" anchor name...it's just that the internal help view won't scroll to the specified location.
