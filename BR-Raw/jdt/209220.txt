[build path] Create Java project dialog has confusing ordering for 508 issues

Build ID: 3.3 Steps To Reproduce: I make a new Java Project, the Create a Java Project dialog has an odd tab order. Under JRE there are two radio buttons for default and a project specific JRE. If you stay on default and press tab, it takes you to “Configure Default…” and then to the next box for Project Layout. However, if you select the project specific JRE, the tab order still goes from the radio button to the “Configure default…” before going to the combo box to select the JRE. More information: It is not a huge issue for Keyboard navigation, but when JAWS screen reader is active, the tab order would be confusing for a blind user. They would not necessarily understand that the combo box is associated with “Use a project specific JRE” because the focus does not go directly from one to the other. If there is a way to go from the radio button to the combo box, even if you must then go to the “Configure defaults…” link it would be better than the way it is now.
