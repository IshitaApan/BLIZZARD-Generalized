JUnit failure opens on single click makes it unusable

I20060413-0010 My setup is as follow: - I have the 'Single click' open mode selected in the preferences. - I have the JUnit view as a fast view in vertical orientation When I click on a failure (upper pane of the JUnit view), it now closes the JUnit view to show me the corresponding .java file. In 3.2 M6 and before, selecting a failure used to only show the failure trace in the lower pane). This 'feature' makes it impossible to see the failure trace. The open mode should be followed only in the 'Failure trace' pane.
