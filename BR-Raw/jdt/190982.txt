[introduce parameter object] clean up refactoring activation code

I20070605-0010 The code in RefactoringExecutionStarter.startIntroduceParameterObject(IMethod, Shell) does too much work outside of the refactoring. We should move the initialization code from IntroduceParameterObjectRefactoring's constructor to checkInitialConditions(..) and just abort with fatal RefactoringStatus.
