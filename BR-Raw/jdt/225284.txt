[breadcrumb] click between icon and text does nothing

I20080401-0851 Breadcrumb item selection feels unreliable: A click between icon and text (at the sport where no tooltip appears) does nothing. It should select the item like when I click on icon or text. Right-click also does nothing, unless the breadcrumb bar already has focus.
