Inline method: creates same AST 4 times [refactoring]

I20040430 The current implementation of InlineAction#run(ITextSelection) is rather expensive. If you set the caret to a method call and run Refactor > Inline, the same AST (with bindings) is created 4 times: 3 times for each try... method and a last time when the refactoring is finally executed. The problem is that we don't pass the AST around.
