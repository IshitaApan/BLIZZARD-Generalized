[package explorer] Plug-in Dependencies in Package Explorer does not update

Reproduced on RC1 and I20070529-0010 The Plug-in Dependencies node which reflects the PDE classpath container in a plug-in project does not get updated when an Import-Package header is added/removed from a bundle. Steps to reproduce 1) Start an empty workspace 2) Create a plug-in project with all the defaults called test.exporter 3) Add the package test.exporter as an exported package 4) Create a plug-in project with all the defaults called test.importer 5) Add the following Import-Package header Import-Package: test.exporter 6) Notice that the Plug-in Dependencies do not change in Package Explorer 7) Open properties for the project and notice that the Java Build Path looks correct under Libraries->Plug-in Dependencies. The test.exporter project is listed there. You can also successfully reference the test.exporter.Activator class from the test.importer.Activator class in the test.importer bundle. It seems like the project classpath *is* getting updated correctly but is not accurately reflected in package explorer. Closing and reopening the project gets it back in sync.
