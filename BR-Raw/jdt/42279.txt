unwanted indents after if()/for()/while()....

Since 3.0m3 (and one or two integration builds before it) i get an automatic indent after controll statements like if()+new line. So my code looks like this (only automatic indents): public class Main { 	void someMethod() 	{ 		if(true) 			{ 				// this doesn't look good 			} 			else if(1==1) 				{ 					// this is getting even worse 				} 				// oh my god :( 	} } After running the code formater the code looks like expected public class Main { 	void someMethod() 	{ 		if (true) 		{ 			// this doesn't look good 		} 		else if (1 == 1) 		{ 			// this is getting even worse 		} 		// oh my god :( 	} } If there is a switch i didn't didn't find: sorry. If not: please fix it asap
