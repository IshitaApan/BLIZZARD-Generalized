[api][content assist] allow contributions to filter and sort proposals

Split off bug 110913: There are currently no provisions that allow contributions to filter or sort the content assist proposals contributed by other completion proposal computers. Currently we don't have any provisions for either problem. Please add your thoughts and requirements to this PR. --- A) Filtering Problem: Eclipse Rule "Add, don't remove". We generally don't allow an extension to remove (filter) contributions made by another extension. In code assist, this may be needed however. The use case is APT, wich may be able to offer much preciser proposals inside annotations than JDT. B) Sorting 1) Overall Sorting How can multiple extensions settle for a common ranking mechanism without knowing each other? One idea is to create coarse-grained slots on a number range which all contributions could use, while still allowing an extension to more precisely sort its contributions. Example: Probable [75.0, 100.0) Over Average [50.0, 75.0) Bulk [25.0, 50.0) Possible [ 0.0, 25.0) JDT could still create a very precise ranking of its proposals inside one slot. 2) Relative ranking There are a number of places where an extension B knows about the proposals of extension A and wants to rank its proposals depending on the A proposals. Example: Templates that match a Java keyword should be ranked just before the proposal for that keyword.
