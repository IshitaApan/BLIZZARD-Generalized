Can't use 5.0 After Setting Compliance to 5.0

I200411022000 When starting a fresh workspace the "Use default compliance settings" check box is no longer checked (was checked in 2.0 to 3.0.1 - didn't check 1.0). If a user only changes compliance to 5.0 the settings will be incorrect and the project is not usable for 5.0 development. Martin please check whether we did something in the UI. If not, send down to J Core.
