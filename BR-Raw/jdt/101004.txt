Make package delete hierarchical

Using Eclipse 3.1 RC3, create a Java project and then a package, say: a.b.c.d.e Try to delete this package in the Java perspective. It will only delete one segment at a time. e.g.: 1 delete => a.b.c.d 2 deletes => a.b.c 3 deletes => a.b 4 deletes => a 5 deletes => finally deleted. This is highly unusable and I don't think this was an issue with RC2.
