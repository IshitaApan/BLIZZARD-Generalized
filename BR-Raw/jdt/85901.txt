Code assist/auto completion - overwrite method not working

Overwriting methods from superclass with two or more parameters does not work properly in M5. It gives me the method header without the body and all parameter types fully qualified. When i disable Prefs->Java->Code Assist->Advanced->"Add import instead of qualified name" code assist gives me no autocompletion for overriding methods at all. Example: import java.util.Random; public class Foo { public void f(Random a, int b) { } } public class Bla extends Foo { f//hit ctrl-space } With "Add import instead of qualified name" checked, choosing the override f() from Foo in the code assist popup will lead to public class Bla extends Foo{ public void f(java.util.Random a,int b)// cursor blinking here } With "Add import instead of qualified name" unchecked, the code assist popup does not show me any override options at all. Autocompletion for methods with no or one parameter(s) seem to work.
