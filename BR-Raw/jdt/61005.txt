Quick Type Hierarchy shows disabled label for private method

I20040505-0200 class A { 	private void method() {} } Show Hierarchy (Ctrl+T) on method() -> was: classes "Object" and "A", both displayed "disabled" (white-and-grey icon, grey text) -> expected: only "Object" is disabled, "A" is colorful (defines the method)
