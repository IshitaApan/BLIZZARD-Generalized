[refactoring] Extract method: only one change offered in preview pane

Against N20050606-0010. In 3.0, the preview pane for Extract Method offered two changes, which the user might individually turn off: 1) "add new method foo" 2) "substitute statement(s) with call to foo" In 3.1, there appears to be only "add new method foo". To prevent confusion, perhaps the description of the change should be changed to "add new method to foo and substitute statement(s) with call to foo".
