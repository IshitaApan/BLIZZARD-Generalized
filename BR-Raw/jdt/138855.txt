RefactoringAvailabilityTester.isPullUpAvilable parses CU

N20060426 Take the project in the attachment and right click on the very large CU E.java, wait a minute or two until context menu opens. The problem is, that RefactoringAvailabilityTester.isPullUpAvilable forces the CU to be parsed on right click, wich sould never happen. See attached YourKit profile.
