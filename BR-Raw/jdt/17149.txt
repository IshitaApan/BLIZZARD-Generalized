Libraries-Path in Java Build Path gets broken

eclipse-version: F1, linux-gtk bug: "Libraries-Path" of external JARs in "Java Build Path" gets broken I observed the following bug: 1) Call the "Java Build Path"-Dialog via selecting a project, "Properties" via right mouse button and then "Java Build Path". 2) Enter a library path via "Add External JARs..." and press "OK" Everything is ok so far. 3) Call the "Java Build Path"-Dialog again: The path to the library I entered before is broken and eclipse does not find the library any more. The path in the project's .classpath-file is ok. example: I created the project "dummy". Tried to add the external JAR "jdom.jar" to the Library-Path. jdom.jar resides in the directory "/home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build". I selected the path as an "external JAR" . The path is shown correctly in the libraries-list. When I called the "Java Build Path"-Dialog again the path listed in the "Java Build Path"-Dialog / "Libraries" is changed to "home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar" (without the first slash). When selecting this entry and clicking on "Edit" the path shown in the "Edit Class Folder"-dialog is "mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar" (without "/home/"). After trying to correct the path manually in the "Edit Class Folder"-dialog the path shown in "Java Build Path"-Dialog / "Libraries" is "dummy/home/mike/java/workspace/jdom/build/jdom.jar". My workaround so far is to create variables for each library and to enter the library paths as variables.
