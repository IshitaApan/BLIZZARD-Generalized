Refactor doesn't work with cast and spacing.

I explain my problem with a little piece of code. If you have this example code: class NonnaPapera { } class Paperino extends NonnaPapera { } public class TestRefactor { 	public static void main(String[] args) 	{ 		Paperino paperino = new Paperino(); 		NonnaPapera nonnaPapera = ( NonnaPapera )paperino; 	} } I have refactored the name of class NonnaPapera in Pippo and Eclipse trasform the code in this way: class Pippo { } class Paperino extends Pippo { } public class TestRefactor { 	public static void main(String[] args) 	{ 		Paperino paperino = new Paperino(); 		Pippo nonnaPapera = ( NPippo)paperino; 	} } As you can see the line Pippo nonnaPapera = ( NPippo)paperino; is WRONG!!! insted of Pippo nonnaPapera = ( Pippo )paperino;
