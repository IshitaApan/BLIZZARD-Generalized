[actions] Source menu should be enabled for working set selections

The Package Explorer's "Source" menu is not available when you select one or more working sets, and it would be helpful if it was. Today, if you want to run "Source > Clean Up..." for every project in a working set, you have to expand the working set and manually select the projects. Clearly a working set can contain projects for which "Source" menu options don't apply, but they should simply ignore the operation.
