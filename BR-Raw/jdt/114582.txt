[build path] New Java Project wizard throws exceptions when .classpath or .project are invalid

I20051031-2000 Try to create a new java project at a location where a .classpath or a .project file already exists, but is invalid. - invalid .project file: An exception is logged and a dialog shows up, explaining that the .project file "has been changed on disk", etc. . After pressing OK, the second page of the wizard shows up and throws NPE on every mouse click. Expected: either .project file gets overridden by a new one, or the wizard gets closed and the operation is aborted. - invalid .classpath file: An exception is silently written to the log, and a project is set up without a JRE library. Expected: A dialog that tells that the .classpath file was invalid. Then, a new .classpath file should be generated, like when there was none before (i.e. detecting source folders and adding a jre library).
