[breadcrumb] BreadcrumbItems not disposed when editor closed

HEAD BreadcrumbItems are leaked (not disposed) when a Java editor is closed. Found that by adding the following to org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget: // --- Find undisposed widgets: --- private Error creation; { creation = new Error("Widget not disposed before finalized! Created at:"); } protected void finalize() throws Throwable { if (!isDisposed()) { creation.printStackTrace(); } } //--- End find undisposed widgets. --- From looking at the code, I think there are more leaks in the breadcrumb: BreadcrumbViewer does not extend handleDispose(), never disposes of the fToolTipLabelProvider (which installs global listeners), etc.
