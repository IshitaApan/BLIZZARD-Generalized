[misc] Java editor does not read lines in JAWS 4.5

3.0 M1 There has been a change in the Java editor since version 2.1.1 that now confuses the JAWS screen reader. It no longer gives the contents of each line but now says "begin" only. STEPS 1) Start JAWS 4.5 2) Open a Java Editor 3) Use the arrow keys to read each line In version 2.1.1 this works fine but not in 3.0 M1. Please note that Ialso tried this with the Window Eyes screen reader and it had no problem so I suspect it is related to the screen scraping algorithm JAWS uses.
