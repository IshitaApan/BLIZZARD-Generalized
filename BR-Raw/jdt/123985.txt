[code templates] Code template preference page wrongly computes selection

I20060110-1026 Steps to reproduce: - Goto code template preference page - Select tree nodes "Code", "New Java files" and "Class body" - Press Export... -> File dialog with caption "Exporting 12 Code Template(s)" appears -> Caption should be "Export Templates" as in other places -> Only 10 templates should be exported
