[api] NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo can't be used if not last page

Build ID: Version: 3.4.0 I20071213-1700 Steps To Reproduce: Simple steps for add third page (not suggesting this is a valid thing to do since the class is internal): - subclass internal class JavaProjectWizard - use: @Override public void addPages () { super.addPages (); // Add the third page. // pageThree = new MyPageThree (); // addPage (pageThree); } - try to access project from third page code. ===> when navigating to the third page, the project isn't there any more. More information: Since NewJavaProjectWizardPageTwo.setVisible(false) removes the project (ie. the project is deleted when you navigate away from the second page), any settings which are set on this page are lost when navigating away from this page -- either back to page one or to a new page three. So these new API classes only work if the user uses page one, then page two, then finishes. Related to Bug 160985, same(?) cause as bug 214563
