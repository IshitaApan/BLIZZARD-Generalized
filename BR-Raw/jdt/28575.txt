Hierarchy view updates items twice [type hierarchy]

build 20021216 -place a println in StructuredViewer.updatePlus that prints out the element -open a class in the outline view -select the class and open in type hierarchy ->The method outline pane in the hierarchy view is updated twice. To verify, switch the hierarchy view to show only the hierarchy and open the type again in the hierarchy view. There will be no method item updates. Noticed this while verifying bug 16607.
