E3.1RC3 User Library Prefs LoadSave  status msg

Eclipse 3.1RC3 There are User Library Preferences LoadSave dialog status messages that are not being displayed. This is because the LoadSaveDialog is not registering as a DialogFieldListener for fExportImportList. The fix... IN: UserLibraryPreferencePage.LoadSaveDialog (constructor) ADD: fExportImportList.setDialogFieldListener(this);
