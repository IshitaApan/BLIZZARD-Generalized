New Search shows annotations in internal jar (for matches in class file)

3.0 M8 - import org.junit as binary plug-in project - search for references to type "TestListener" - select the library junit.jar - from context menu, choose Open With > Text Editor -> invalid "matches" are shown in the editor Problem is probably in JavaSearchResult#getFile(Object), which should not getUnderlyingResource() for JavaElements not in a ICompilationUnit.
