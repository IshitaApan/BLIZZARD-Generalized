[nls tooling] NLS refactoring issues (has patch)

- Open a java file - Right-click -> Source -> Externalize strings This dialog has several problems: 1. The dialog is modal. It should be nonmodal to make it easier to - for example - search your source file to to see how a format string is used elsewhere. 2. If you select an Eclipse message bundle from the combo box, the prefix does not change from a "." to a "_", and needs to be changed manually by the user. 3. The default selection in the combo box always points to a bundle in the same package. If the user is using one-bundle-per-plugin rather than one-bundle-per-package, this means they always need to change the defaults. The default should point to an existing message bundle if one can be found - that way both one-bundle-per-package and one-bundle-per-plugin users will rarely need to change the default. I'm attaching a patch that fixes all three issues.
