[refactoring] inline method shows "no changes" for non-fatal error

I20050509-2000 (M7 test pass) Scenario similar to bug 90772: - have this CU: package m7testing; /** * @since 3.1 */ public class SubDeprecation { 	/** 	 * @see Other#foo() 	 */ 	public void foo() { 		System.out.println("foo"); 	} 	 	void m() { 		foo(); 	} } - caret on the foo declaration - Inline Method, make sure "Inline All' is checked - Press 'Preview' > warning dialog, warning about an inaccurate reference in the javadoc comment of 'foo' - Press 'Continue' > expected: refactoring is executed < actual: Dialog saying "Refactoring does not change any sourcecode" Note that the same works if the 'inaccurate reference' is not present
