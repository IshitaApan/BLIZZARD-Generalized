Clicking on methods in the hierarchy view shows the top of the file in the editor

Build 20020528 - 20020530. Clicking on a member or method in the hierarchy view with the "Show source of selected elements only" on, goes to the top of the file. This seems to be a regression as I saw this bug half a year ago. -Leon
