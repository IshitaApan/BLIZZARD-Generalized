junit view: showing errors only takes a long time

I20060213-0010 - run a large (huge) test suite, such as All ZRH tests - in the junit view, choose to view all tests - then choose to view only errors > note that the filtering takes a long time, presumeably because all tests are iterated and errors collected. Switching between errors / all may be a frequent thing to do. AFAIR, the previous view did maintain both lists and there was no delay when switching back and forth.
