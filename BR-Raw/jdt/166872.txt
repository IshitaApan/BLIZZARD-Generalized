[CommonNavigator] empty JarPackageFragment nodes fail to get filtered in hierarchical layout of Project Explorer

I believe that the problem here is a duplicate of bug 148759, which was fixed for the Package Explorer but now occurs in the Project Explorer. The description regarding the Package Explorer on bug 148759 is as follows. As before we need this to support Mylar's interest filtering on the Project Explorer's hierarchical package presentation. The comment on PackageExplorerPart.createViewer is: 	 * This viewer ensures that non-leaves in the hierarchical 	 * layout are not removed by any filters. While this may make sense for many filters, it is preventing Mylar users from using the hierarchical layout because empty nodes end up being shown (see attachment). Could this rule be updated to "filter *empty* non-leaf" nodes instead, where determining "empty" allows all the filters applied to the viewer to run?
