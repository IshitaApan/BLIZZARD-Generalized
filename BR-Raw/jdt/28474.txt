selection in packages view incorrect when switching editors

use project swt in source for example. 1) open an editor for cu COM in org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32. open an editor for a cu in a different project. 3)make sure browsing view is linked to editor 2)make sure packages view is in hierarchical mode. 3)click in package explorer on project swt. DO NOT expand in packages view. 4)now bring the editor for COM to top. Notice the expansion in the packages view is not complete. Ie. the logical package org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win23 is not visible and highlighted. 20021216. JRT.
