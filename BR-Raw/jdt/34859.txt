[wording]  wizard titles

from Nick: Tooltips on toolbar buttons should be the same as what would be used in a menu item for the action (excluding any mnemonics or elipses) and should use book title capitalization. Also, the titles of dialogs should correspond to the invoking action (whether invoked by menus or toolbar buttons). JDT: - Create a Java Project -> New Java Project - Create a Java Package -> New Java Package - Create a Scrapbook Page -> New Scrapbook Page - also, the labeling on the wizard is inconsistent with the others - it would be good to have a description here explaining what a scrapbook page is - Create a Java Class -> New Java Class - Open a Type in the Editor -> Open Type
