[code manipulation] generate ctor using fields: duplicate warning does not consider erasure

I20050329-2000 Consider this CU: --------- class Generic<T> { 	T fT; 	public Generic(T field) { 		fT= field; 	} } class SubGeneric<E extends Number> extends Generic<E> { 	E fE; 	Number fNumber; 	 	public SubGeneric(E field, Number n) { 		super(field); 	} 	 } ----------------- - in SubGeneric, execute Source>Create ctor using fields - in the dialog, select fNumber -> Note: the dialog displays a warning, that the created ctor might be a duplicate - in the dialog, uncheck fNumber and check fE > expected: the duplicate warning would appear as well < actual: the duplicate warning does not appear. Executing the change will produce a second constructor that does not compile, as it has the same erasure as the already existing one.
