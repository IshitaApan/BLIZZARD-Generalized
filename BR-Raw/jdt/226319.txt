[misc] ContentAssistTestSuite uses lots of memory

20080409 I run the ContentAssistTestSuite and ran out of memory. When inspecting with yourkit I saw that half of the memory (30 MB) is used in the UISynchronizer.messages; that's the queue of async-execs to be executed. The fix would be to run the display loop between tests until empty. This would also make sure that the next test can start in a cleaner state.
