Navigator sort wrong in Java Source Attachment -> Workspace

If you rc a jar file, properties, java source attachment, and then click workspace, and then navigate to a lib directory which contains sub directories, the subdirectories and files are treated as items and sorted whereas in the main navigator subdirectories are given higher sort order over file items.
