java browsing: package view not updated sometimes [browsing]

20021216 maybe it's the desired behavior, i don't know. but it feels strange 1. junit 3.7 with 2 src folders (one has everything and the other some random packages) 2. select the project - stuff is shown in packages view 3. select a package 4. select the project again - nothing happens in the packages view to make anything change you have to click around a couple of times
