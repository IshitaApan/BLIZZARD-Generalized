Generalize Type disables after cancelling Change Method Signature

In N20050622-0010. Code: import java.util.ArrayList; public class MyList extends ArrayList { 	ArrayList friend = null; 	 	public int size() { 		return 1; 	} } 1) After creating the class, close the editor and re-open. Check that Refactor > Generalize Type is enabled. 2) Use the Alt+Shift+T quick menu on size, and select Change Method Signature. 3) You will be told that this affects a superclass method. Select No. 4) The Refactor > Generalize Type action is now disabled. It remains disabled even when an applicable target like "friend" is selected. Similar to bug 101210, the action can be re-enabled by choosing an applicable target and invoking Generalize Type from the quick menu. One difference in this case is that the bug is exhibited only if the quick menu is used in step 2--using the menu bar or key combo do not disable Generalize Type.
