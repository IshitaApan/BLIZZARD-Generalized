Call Hierarchy fails to find calls to binary private method

3.1 From bug 83493: Open source for org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.PropertySheetViewer Find callers of activateCellEditor(TreeItem item). It does not find any caller, although there is (at least) one, in PropertySheetViewer.handleSelect(). This is on Eclipse 3.1. Analysis: We choose the search scope too narrow in this case, see RefactoringScopeFactory#createReferencingScope().
