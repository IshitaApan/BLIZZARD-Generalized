[javadoc wizard] Cannot change default javadoc command

I can't find a way to set the default javadoc command offered by the javadoc wizard. Now it offers me two choices, both of which correspond to two different versions of Java 1.4 that I have uninstalled long ago. I've entered in it /usr/bin/javadoc and /usr/lib/j2.../bin/javadoc uncountable times, and although the correct command is then used, the next time I start the dialog it still only offers me the old settings. I greped my metadata dir for one of the two current options, and I found the following two matches: .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs:command=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-ibm/bin/javadoc .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/dialog_settings.xml: <item key="javadoc_command_history" value="/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-ibm/bin/javadoc:/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4-sun/bin/javadoc"/> In case it matters, I've been converting this workspace along since Eclipse 2.1, passing through 3.0 and a couple 3.1 release candidates, and finally 3.1. Now I'm using Eclipse 3.1.1. I think I remember that at some point I found a way to select the default command, but that might have been with a long unavailable configuration UI.
