[organize imports] Organize Imports alternates including annotation defined on parent

When you have a class which extends another class and includes an annotation defined inside that parent class. Organize Imports alternates including that import. // File 1 package first; import java.lang.annotation.*; public abstract class Parent { @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.TYPE) public @interface Tag{ String value(); 	} } // File 2 package other; import first.Parent; import first.Parent.Tag; @Tag("foo") public class Child extends Parent { } When you type Ctrl-Shift-O the second import in file 2 (first.Parent.Tag) disappears. When you click it again it appears. This alternating behavior is quite annoying.
