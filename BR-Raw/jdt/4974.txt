Set classpath / output location should be one operation

204: 1. create a project with 'src' as source folder and 'bin' as output location. 2. in the project properties change the setting to use the project as source folder and the project as output location. Press Ok You get the error message: 'Cannot nest outputfolder /xy in source folder /xy/src' The problem is that setting outputlocation and classpath are two operations. By setting the first, an illegal state is created. -> Like the validation (checking classpath and outputlocation at once), the setting of classpath / output location should be offered as one operation. Note that the error message is strange. I guess it should say: '/xy/src' can not be nested in '/xy'
