[preferences] UserLibraryPreferencePage: After renaming a user library the Up, Down, Remove buttons do not work until dialog is reopened

Build Identifier: 20100218-1602 When you open the user library preference page and rename a library, you won't be able to remove jar files from it (or change the order) until you close and reopen the dialog. I am sorry that I do not have the time to dive into the code and search for a fix but I wanted to report it anyways. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open or create a workspace with at least one User Library that has jar files in it 2. Go to the "User Libraries" dialog (e.g. Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries 3. Select a User Library, click Edit and rename it (e.g. Test -> Test2) 4. Try to use the Up/Down/Remove button on one of the jar files inside the user library. The click has no result.
