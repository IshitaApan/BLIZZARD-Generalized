Open Type Dialog doesn't behave as expected for former VAJ users

When using the 'Open Type' dialog in VisualAge for Java, you can type a few letters of the class name, and then use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to quickly select the desired type from the list. In Eclipse, you are required to hit the TAB key or use the mouse to move the focus to the list of types. Since a large number of Eclipse users are likely current/former VAJ users (who would likely consider this a bug), it would be nice if the Eclipse behavior could be changed to match VAJ.
