[navigation] Double-Clicking does not do anything sometimes

FUP of bug 285957 comment #28 Build : I20110425-1800 In a string like "word1" double click at the end of the word selects the previous word ex: "word1.word.word._word4._word5" // double click after end of each word before '.' whereas in other cases it does not do anything ex: String b = "Hello"; // double click after b double b= 100.234; // double click after 4 System.out.println(""); //double click before '.' => Should select the previous character/word.
