Refactoring - Pull up shows java code with bad colors [refactoring]

A dialog comes up under the Pull up refactoring that says"Select the methods to be removed in subtypes after pull up." The right hand panel shows java code for the selected method. It *assumes* the background color should be white, when it should not. It should be the same color as defined for Java editors. See #43368, #42704, #42703, & #41867
