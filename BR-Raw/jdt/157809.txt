[clean up] improve the clean up preference keys

20060919-0010 - the preference keys are currently in the form of 'org.eclipse.jdt.uicleanup.add_default_serial_version_id' I suggest to change them to 'cleanup.add_default_serial_version_id' we should do this for M2 before users are releasing these keys to their projects
