Error while deleting resources

An error dialog is displayed while deleting resources, and a few exceptions are printed to the log. I haven't tested how reproducible this problem is. The machine is Eclipse-GTK-I20030925, GNOME, RedHat 9. STEPS: 1.) Make a workspace containing CVS projects for the platform-ui module, and binary projects with linked content for the remaining Eclipse projects. (this project is from a previous I-build) 2.) Select all the binary projects, from the top to the bottom. 3.) Press the "Delete" key. OBSERVED RESULTS: Deletion starts to occur, but stops at some point with an error dialog. Closing the dialog and pressing delete again completes the deletion.
