Package Explorer error marker icon not updated

I have a custom builder which is invoked after a save (CTRL+S) that identifies problems with resources in my non-Java project and marks the resource with errors (or clears them as needed). This seems to work fine except that the problem marker icons in the Package Explorer are for some reason not automatically updated. Selecting the 'Go Into' context menu option and then navigating back again shows the correct problem marker icon state. Alternatively, closing and opening the project/eclipse displays the correct icon state. Is there something that needs to be called in order to 'refresh' the problem markers in the Package Explorer view? This is happening under Linux (RH9) using Eclipse 2.1.2 Comments from newsgroup: "The decorator handles this case the problem updater does not. "
