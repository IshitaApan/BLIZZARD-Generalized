JavaUI.revealInEditor doesn't handle ICompilationUnits properly

When calling JavaUI.revealInEditor with an ICompilationUnit, then the package declaration is revealed. This isn't useful, passing an ICompilationUnit should be treated as a no-op. Otherwise clients need to guard against revealing the package declaration in their code (see OpenResourceAction as an example)
