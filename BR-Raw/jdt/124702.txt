[projection] redraw problem with JavaEditor.resetProject()

After calling resetProjection() the CompilationUnitEditor seems to keep the [..] annotations on each region that could be folded (see screenshot attached). If anything redraws the editor (e.g. scrolling, activating another editor), the annotations disappear. Note that in the screnshot I made one partly disappear by scrolling.
