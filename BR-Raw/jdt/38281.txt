Move refactoring misses plugin.xml entries [refactoring]

When I move multiple classes and choose to update plugin.xml files as well, it seems that only one change is ever found in the plugin.xml file, even it multiple hits should occur. For example, I just moved a group of five classes from one package to another. Each of these classes is referenced in extensions points in the plugin.xml, but only the last match in the plugin.xml was actually updated.
