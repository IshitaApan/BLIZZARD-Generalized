don't suppress classpath entities at their original locations

When a jar that is part of a java project is added to that project's classpath, the Package Explorer view suppresses the jar from being displayed at its original location in the file system tree. The same behavior is seen with class and source directories. While this behavior might be ok for classpath entries added manually, this behavior is bad when classpath entries are contributed automatically by a classpath container. WTP has a classpath container that automatically adds jars from web project's WEB-INF/lib directory to its classpath. As soon as a jar is dropped into the WEB-INF/lib directory it is picked up by the container. This makes it disappear from the original location in the Package Explorer view (drop target) leaving the users befuddled. Not only that, but once the jar has been added in order to delete the jar they have to switch to the Resource Navigator view. WTP has received at least half a dozen bugs reports pertaining to this behavior. Would it be possible to continue displaying resources at their original locations after they are added to the classpath?
