[preferences] Make User Library use/support relative paths

Our project uses a whole bunch of different libraries. With this we have two problems: 1. it makes it harder than necessary for new developers in our team to setup their Eclipse environment since they need to add each individual library manually 2. each time a jar file is upgraded, removed or added each developer has to adjust his/hers project's Java Build Path -> Libraries accordingly Rejected solutions: 1. We cannot share .project and .classpath since our directory structure is not the exact same 2. Maven and the Maven plugin for Eclipse could do the job for us but a) as of now it's to big of a step to take b) the plugin is not fully functional and c) we have stuff that Maven currently does not handle So, we came to think of using a User Library (Project Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries -> Add Library -> User Library) since it can be exported/imported. However, the absolute path is saved for the jar files in the User Library. I would like it to save the path relative to the project root instead, so that we can use the same User Library within our project (as only the project root directory changes). Is this possible to change in some way?
