User Libraries dialog loses settings [build path]

When adding or modifying User Libraries I can't get certain settings to stick. I currently have 9 user defined libraries and in total 18 JAR files. When I try and change one of the libraries to be a system library and OK the dialog and go back in, the setting doesn't stick. I also had the experience of adding a couple of JARS to a user defined library and upon returning to the dialog they had dissappeared. Do I have too many JAR files? Help. Thanks, Gordon
