AST: new type IResolvedAnnotation

20060110 A new types IResolvedAnnotation and IResolvedMemberValuePair has been added to the AST. It basically represents a new kind of binding that group the bindings of an annotation and the agruments of an annotation. IMO this might be handy, but doesn't really fit in the existing style of the AST. The existing bindings are enough tor represent the information required. e.g. annotation.resolveTypeBinding() gives you directly access to the binding of the annotation. To simplify the access to the bindings of the attributes, why not add a method annotation.resolveAnnotationArguments() : IMethodBinding[] and for the values a API annotation.resolveAnnotationValues() : Object[] (I'm not sure if the annotation values really help much here, they are only in vary rare cases configured) resulting in no new types.
