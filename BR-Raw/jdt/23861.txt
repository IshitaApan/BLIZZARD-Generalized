Extract Local Variable Input Page - does not show warning message for atypical but valid variable names (e.g. begins with uppercase letter)

The input page should show warning message (in the bar containing the refactoring name near the top of the page) for atypical but valid variable names (e.g. begins with uppercase letter). Code is already present for doing this, but it does not acheive its desired effect.
