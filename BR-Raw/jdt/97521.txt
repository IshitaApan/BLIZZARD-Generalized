[refactoring] [move] Move method to generic type

In RC1, given code: public class A { 	<T> void foo(B<T> b) { 		 	} } class B<T> { 	 } Select "foo", and "move method". b is offered as a target, but if selected, the user is told: "This method could not be moved to the specified target, since the target is a generic entity". Ideally, the move would be allowed, since the type parameters on the method and class match. Failing that, would it be possible to not offer b in the first place?
