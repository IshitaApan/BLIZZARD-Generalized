Enable 'Java > Appearance > Show method return type' by default

In 3.5, we should enable 'Java > Appearance > Show method return type' by default. It probably used to be off in the past because the label could become a bit noisy, but this is not a problem any more with colored labels. And people usually like it when I show them that the feature exists.
