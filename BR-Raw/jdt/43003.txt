Disable warning/don't show again checkbox

When I reorder the contents of a source file using 'Source -> Sort Members' I get given a warning box that says task tags will be lost, click OK to continue. Whilst this is a useful warning to show the first time this occurs, it would really be great to be able to disable the warning so that it does not occur each time I am trying to work with code. A preferences checkbox showing disabled warnings, or even using the new 'Error/Warn/Ignore' for Java compile issues could be used so that the warning wasn't shown again, and/or a checkbox on the dialog saying 'Do not show this warning again'. NB the dialog of course only appears in files that have task markers, which I usually have in the form of a // TODO marker when I see this problem. Mac OS X.2.6/Eclipse 3.0M3
