Opening .class file fails

- build 20020528 - I have loaded a number of classes from the cvs repository at org.eclipse.dev (HEAD stream). Among them are org.eclipse.core.runtime and org.eclipse.core.boot - Search->File - fill in "findResource(" in the 'Containing Text' field - leave everything else as default (searching the workspace and for file name patterns '*') - do the search - I get 2 hits: DelegatingURLClassLoader.class (org.eclipse.core.boot/bin/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot) and DelegatingURLClassLoader.java (org.eclipse.core.boot/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot) - 10 matches - try to open the first file in the search result (which doesn't really make sense since it is a .class file) - you get the error: Could not open the editor Reason: bin/org/eclipse/core/internal/boot does not exist - But it does exist and there is a DelegatingURLClassLoader.class there. - Now try to redo the search - Search->File - in the 'Containing Text' field you find "findResource(ú67" (i.e added garbage to the end of my search string).
