[package explorer] Open project menu item appears when it shouldn't

I20060214-0800 This only happens with java projects in package explorer which is why I open on JDT. - Start with fresh workspace - Create new java project in package explorer - Delete the project - Right click in package explorer - Bug: I see an "Open Project" menu item This item wasn't there if I right clicked before creating the project.
