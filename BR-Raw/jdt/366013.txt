[preferences] Polish preference UI for null annotations

I20111207-2118. The preference UI for nulll annotations looks clumsy and the important parts are coming after the less important settings. We should move the rarely used configuration of the annotations into a separate dialog which has a 'Restore Defaults' button. On the main page we add a 'Configure Annotations...' button (most likely at the end of the section).
