[refactoring] refactoring without modal window

Microsoft Refactor! for Visual Basic 2005 Beta 2 provides refactoring without the overhead of a modal popup window. You really have to see the demos to appreciate the developer productivity enhancements these will provide. All I can say is seeing is believing... Overview of tool: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/2005/tools/refactor/ Short videos that demo this functionality: http://msdn.microsoft.com/VBasic/Downloads/2005/Tools/Refactor/30SecDemo.Aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/VBasic/Downloads/2005/Tools/Refactor/3MinDemo.Aspx ===================================== - Clicking a variable in the text editor presents a refactoring dropdown icon, the Microsoft Smart Tag, that allows the variable to be renamed or moved near its first reference. - Clicking on the refactoring dropdown icon lists the possible refactorings and a short description about what the refactoring does to the code. - Block highlighted code presents a refactoring dropdown icon that lists possible refactorings when clicked. This icon saves the developer from having to right click the block and select the refactoring menu. - The Extract Method refactoring automatically attempts to give the method a name based on comments that come before the highlighted block. If the code comment was "Do a big job" the method would automatically be named doBigJob. A large visual indicator is presented to show where the method is to be inserted. A popup menu presents keyboard shortcuts that can be used to control the position of the visual indicator. The up arrow will move the indicator above the previous method, the down arrow will move the indicator below the current method, the enter key accepts the location, and the escape key cancels the refactoring. The default method name is now highlighted so that it can be renamed. - Extract Constant, Extract Local, Extract Field refactorings behaves similar to the Extract Method refactoring. - Clicking on a method name, variable, or parameter highlights the text similar to the mark occurances does today and puts into automatic rename refactoring without a modal window. - Reorder Parameters refactoring requires clicking on the refactoring dropdown icon. This refactoring behaves similar to the Extract Method refactoring in that a menu appears showing the keys that can be used during the refactoring. This time the left arrow moves the parameter left, the right arrow moves the parameter right, the tab selects the next parameter, the shift-tabe selects the previous parameter, the enter commits the changes, and the escape cancels the refactoring. The parameters are visually rearranged. - Cutting and pasting via the clipboard performs an automatic Extract Method refactoring. ===================================== Supported Refactorings without modal windows: Reorder Parameters Extract Method Extract Property Create Overload Surrounds With Encapsulate field Reverse Conditional Simplify expression Introduce Local Introduce constant Inline Temp Replace Temp with Query Split Temporary Variable Move initialization to declaration Split initialization from declaration Move declaration near reference
