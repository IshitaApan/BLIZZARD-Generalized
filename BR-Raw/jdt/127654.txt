Package Explorer Working set mode: Selection jumps to other file upon rename

I20060214-0010. Use the Package Explorer in working set mode and make sure to show overlapping working sets i.e. same file visible multiple times. Select that file (not the first one) and then Context menu > Rename... ==> selection jumps to first occurrence of the file in the Package Explorer. Expected: selection stays stable. My test case was to use exportplugin.xml from JDT UI (HEAD).
