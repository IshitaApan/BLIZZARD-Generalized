Generated delegate methods not qualified with 'this.' in field accesses.

I'm using 3.0M7 GTK on X4.3, Kernel 2.6.3. When I select a field, and use the context menu's Source->Generate Delegate Methods... and select some method, the generated method does not have the field qualified with 'this.', even though I have that preference set in Preferences->Code Generation->Names->Qualify all generated field accesses with 'this.' I'll attach my preferences and a snapshot of the preferences panel in the next comments.
