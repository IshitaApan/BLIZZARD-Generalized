Code completion does not filter fully qualified class names

Steps to reproduce: - Type: java.io. - Press CTRL+SPACE to make the Auto completion box appear. - Type: O The auto completion box then disapears. It should instead filter out those classes that do not begin with O. I'm using build 20020607.
