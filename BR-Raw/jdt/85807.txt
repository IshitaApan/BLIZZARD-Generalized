ImportRewrite#addImport(...): javadoc should tell that result can be used as variable type

I20050217-2000 If I understand that correctly, all ImportRewrite#addImport(...) methods should be able to deal with anonymous and array types/bindings: - they add imports for all types referenced in the given type reference - they return a type that can be used to declare a variable to which an object of the original type can be assigned The javadocs should be updated to include these two points.
