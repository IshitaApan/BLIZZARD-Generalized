[clean up] removes required parentheses around nested conditional expression

Build ID: I20070503-1400 Steps To Reproduce: public int method() { return (true ? true : true) ? 0 : 1; } Simply run the "Use parentheses around conditions, Only if necessary" code cleanup on that code. The parentheses get removed, which then makes the code incorrect. More information: Per the Java Language Specification, Third Edition, section 15.25 <http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.25>: "The conditional operator is syntactically right-associative (it groups right-to-left), so that a?b:c?d:e?f:g means the same as a?b:(c?d:(e?f:g))." Workaround: Don't use a ternary conditional expression as the condition of another ternary condition expression. public int method() { if (true ? true : true) { return 0; } else { return 1; } }
