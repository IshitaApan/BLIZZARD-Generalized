[quick fix] Wrong linked proposals in 'add throws' quick fix

When the user selects the "Add throws declaration" quick fix to add the exceptions thrown by a method, and the number of exceptions thrown is greater than one, then the drop down box presented with the first exception added (re-added in the case that the exception was already in the list) is that of the next exception in the list. Eg: For method that throws "SQLException, InvalidCashMarginTradesFile" The calling method has the following added to it's throws clause as such: +------------+ throws IOException, |SQLException|, InvalidCashMarginTradesFile +------------+--------------+ |InvalidCashMarginTradesFile| |Exception | |Throwable | +---------------------------+ Should I select the first option, the next element is not processed (no drop-down) and I am left with the following: throws IOException, InvalidCashMarginTradesFile, InvalidCashMarginTradesFile If I were adding 3 exceptions, then the first one would have the drop down of the second, as described, the second exception would have the drop-down of the third and the last one would be ignored. My version of Eclipse has been upgraded from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 and then to 3.0.2 via the update mechanism.
