clipboard based copying of java resources - bad copy of package name

1) Copy and paste 'junit.ui'. 2) Observe: the resulting package is named 'ui'. It should be something like 'copy.of.junit.ui' or 'junit.ui.copy.of'. Also compile errors are introduced as the CUs still expect the package name to be 'junit.ui'. 3) Paste again. There's a new folder (not package) called 'Copy of ui'. It should remain a package and have package-like names.
