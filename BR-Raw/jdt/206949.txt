[call hierarchy] filter field accesses (only write or only read)

Build ID: I20071010-1200 + recent patches in HEAD After the call hierarchy has been extended with support for field references in addition to method calls (see bug 75800) it would be great if one could configure this to show only read accesses or only write accesses. Rationale: my most frequent use case is to find all control flows causing a field to be assigned. For this tasks read accesses are just noise in the call hierarchy. Question: should the option to show only read accesses be included for symmetry or is that use case useless? (call that a "useless case" ? ;-) Since this feature would be related to both search and watchpoints, the UI has to choose between - all occurrences, read accesses, write accesses (radio) - field access, field modification (independent check boxes) I personally like the radio style much better. The check boxes for watchpoints keep confusing me, since the default is both checked, and if I want to create a modification-only-watchpoint, I have to click on "Access" (to *deselect*) after creating the watchpoint.
