[Patch] Create Patch ignores lines at end of file

Build id: I20051108-1011 Steps: 1. Create a java class in a cvs project. Leave a new line (CR) after the last "}" in the file. Create a patch for the file. 2. Remove the newline after the last "}" in the file. Create a patch again. -> Observe: Both(!) patches do not include the new line (CR) at the end of the file. Now, re-apply the patches. In both cases (obviously, since the patch files are identical), a new line (CR) is added after the last "}". I would expect newlines to be exactly the way they were when creating a patch and re-applying it. This is a problem when providing patches with new files for refactoring test cases, as the resulting files do not match anymore.
