[generate delegate] is missing final methods

See this example, in class B Eclipse is requested to generate delegate methods from A: public class A { public void a() {} public final void b() {} } public class B { A a; // Methods generated by Eclipse public void a() { a.a(); } // b() is missing! } Method b() is not generated.
