[build path] Derived attribute on default output folder of Java project doesn't work

When I create a new Java project, I configure it with separate source and output folders (src and bin). The code that creates the output folder (BuildPathsBlock.flush) sets the derived attribute on the folder, but when I check the folder's properties later, the folder is not marked as derived. This means that when I shared the project (commit to CVS), the bin folder is going to be added to the repository. If I create Main.java in the default (unnamed) package, the corresponding class file, "project/bin/Main.class" is marked as derived. If I create an empty, top-level package (e.g. "dummy"), the corresponding directory, "project/bin/dummy", is marked as derived. My expectation was that the derived attribute would be set in the properties of the bin folder, and that the folder would not be shared with CVS. Setting the component to UI, but I don't have any confidence that is correct. FYI, tested with 3.2 RC4.
