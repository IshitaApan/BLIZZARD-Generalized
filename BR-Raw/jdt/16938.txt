DCR: Class File Editor should scroll more naturally

20020521 (F1) (This may not be a debug PR - I wasn't sure). - put a breakpoint in a java file, right before a System.out.println statement - debug to the breakpoint - step in to the println call (I happened to go in to StringBuffer first - all that matters is that you do not have the source for the class you just stepped into) - a Class File Editor opens - click on the scrollbar's down arrow Problem: the editor only scrolls one pixel at a time. It should scroll one line at a time when you click on the arrows. - click on the scrollbar's background to scroll a page at a time Problem: the editor only scrolls about a line at a time when it should be scrolling a page at a time. Grabbing the thumb and scrolling with that works well. So the workaround, if the user wants to scroll through the Class File editor, is to always use the thumb.
