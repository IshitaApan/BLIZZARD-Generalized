Refactoring does not do anything...

Build: I-20050202 1. Create a new Hello world plugin project. Call it 'com.example.xyz' and accept all defaults. 2. Close the manifest editor for the newly created plugin.xml to take PDE out of the equation. 3. Open the plugin.xml in a plain text editor. 4. Right-click on the 'com.example.xyz' project and choose to rename it to 'com.example.xyz.bla' with textual matches in plugin.xml files. 5. In the preview, uncheck the 'plugin.xml - com.example.xyz). All its children are now unchecked 6. Check the second match in the plugin.xml file only (ie. the one for the 'class' attribute. 7. click OK. NOTHING HAPPENS!
