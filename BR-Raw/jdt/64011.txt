JavaProjectSourceContainer does not search for non-Java files

Java project source containers can only find Java Source and nothing else. It will only look java files from <JavaProject>/<JavaSource> directory. The Java Project may contain more than just Java files. For example, a web project which is also a Java Project contains JSP and HTML files. In this case, these other sources cannot be located by JavaProjectSourceContainer even though the project is part of the source lookup path. Adding a raw project source container to look for non-Java files may interfere with the source location function of the Java Project Source Container (depending on the order of which the projects are specified). If a Raw Project Source Container is placed in front of the Java Project Container, the Raw Project Source Container may not compute source for a Java file correctly due to its lack of knowledge about classpaths, source inclusion/exclusion filters, etc. JavaProjectSourceContainer should find source for non-Java files and it should look in directories other than the Java-Source directory.
