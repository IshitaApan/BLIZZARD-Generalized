Odd alt+shift+T (surround w/ Try-Catch) behavior

I am getting odd and intermittent alt+shift+T behavior. When I first start Eclipse and open an editor with a statement that needs a try-catch block (it is a compilation error when I open my project) and press alt+shift+T, nothing occurs. All other alt+shift commands work ("R" for renaming, etc). If I alt+shift+Z and cancel out of the popup menu (read: I don't select "Try/Catch Block") and then his alt+shift+T then the surround try-catch will occur. If I close the editor, etc and reopen the alt+shift+T *still* works. If I close and reopen Eclipse and alt+shift+T nothing occurs (until I alt+shift+Z again as stated above). Selecting "Surround With" from the editor context menu (right click) and selecting "Try/Catch Block" *always* works. As does selecting "Try/Catch Block" from the alt+shift+Z menu. Version: 3.2.0 Build id: I20060428-1315 Let me know if there is any way to help!
