Open Type's Window Working Sets setting isn't remembered

Using the the build "I20051206-1200" the "Open Type" dialog doesn't remember the setting "Window Working Sets" for the "Select Working Sets..." option. The other settings are remembered :/ Example: I have a clean workspace, create two projects (A and B, w/ one class each: A and B), assign to two working sets (one containing A, on B) , select project "A" as window working set, selct "Open Type", select "Window Working Sets" in "Select Working Set..." - everything is fine. I close the "Open Type" dialog, reopen it, and the setting is back to "No Working Sets"
