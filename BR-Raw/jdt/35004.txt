remove final from Variable Declaration after surround with try/catch [refactoirng]

consider the code fragment: { ... final File testFile = new File("testFile); ... } after surrounding with a try/catch Block I got something like: { ... final File testFile; try { testFile = new File("testFile); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } ... } The Problem here is that the Compiler complains about the final declaration. I suggest to remove the final from the declaration.
