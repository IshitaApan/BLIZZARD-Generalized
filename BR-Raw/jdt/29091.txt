Protected method created when overridding public method from super class

M4 Using org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.MainTypeSelectionDialog, override TwoPaneElementSelector#createDialogArea(Composite) createDialogArea is created but is has protected visibility. I believe it should have public visibility as TwoPaneElementSelector#createDialogArea(Composite) is public and one cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method.
