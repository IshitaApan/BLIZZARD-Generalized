AnnotationModelPerformanceTest are unreliable

I20080513-2000 Almost every test in the series is unreliable. Either we remove this tests or we try to make them more reliable. To make them more reliable we can try to make them run longer, like 10 times longer. This would also require to backport the tests. The problem is that the performance test already need a lot of time. Also this tests do not really test a real word scenario (see ScrollVerticalRulerTests for real world scenarios), I opt to remove this tests therefore. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ testAddBackwards() This test is very unreliable (standard error 14.2%), although it runs almost 1s... testAddForward() This test is very unreliable (standard error 77.2%), last time it took 165ms testAddRandom() test is almost reliable (standard error 4.3%), it also shows the expected regression, last time it took 531ms testRegionBeforeAfter() This test is very unreliable (standard error 17.7%), last time it took 378ms testRegionBeforeAfterOld() This test is very unreliable (standard error 14.4%), last time it took 362ms testRegionBeforeAfterCompare() They say this test is reliable, which is impossible, it also does not look reliable. The test compares BeforeAfter and BeforeAfterOld, both unreliable. Maybe if you take the average of two unreliable tests you get a reliable one: http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2008-05-07/ :-) testRegionInside() This test is unreliable (standard error 9.1%), last time it took 431ms testRemoveRandom() The only reliable test in the series, it took 4.5s when it was slow, now 553 Hint that I expect this tests to be red once they are reliable: testAddBackwards(), testAddForward(), testAddRandom()
