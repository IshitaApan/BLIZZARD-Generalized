Package Explorer serious drawing problem

I have Windows 2000, JDK 1.4.0_01, Eclipse 2.1 M5 build. For no apparent reason, the package explorer seems to lose its mind for particular sections of the heirarchy. I am able to expand and collapse the tree and interact with it just fine. But certain sections become invisible and the only remedy is to restart eclipse. Please see the attached image. This has happend twice now, and I have no idea why.
