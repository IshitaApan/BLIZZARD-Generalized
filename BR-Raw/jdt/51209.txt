Unhandled event loop exception while trying to open a new file

i am using: I20040203 Tue, 3 Feb 2004 -- 09:05 (-0500) Version: 3.0.0 Build id: 200402030905 I had the IDE open, and the "work in progress" preference for auto refresh was turned on. I created a new java source file using another text editor (ie from outside Eclipse). After waiting for a few minutes, I used Ctrl+Shift+T to open the new class. The new class did appear in the "open java class dialog", but when I clicked on the OK button, nothing happened.
