Show Hourglass Pointer while opening the help system

Even on my 1.8 GHz powered 500MB RAM machine the external online help needs up to five seconds to open when pressing SHIFT-F2 on a source line. Would be great to have visual feedback of the status, e.g. by showing a wait cursor instead of the mouse cursor.
