[API] access to AddUnimplementedMethodsOperation

We are using internal jdt calls to perform some of our operations. In order to add method stubs for unimplemented inherited members, we are using the following internal classes / apis - AddMethodStubOperation - IRequestQuery (requried for AddMethodStubOperation) - StubUtility2 (to find unimplemented methods) - ASTNodes - NodeFinder - RefactoringASTParser - JavaPreferenceSettings (to get CodeGenerationSettings for AddMethodStubOperation) We couldn't find public API to replace this usage. This is blocking our effort to remove access to JDT internal source.
