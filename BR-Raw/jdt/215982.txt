[generate constructor] 'Cursor position' not honored

Build ID: I20071213-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a new class: class Test { 	private int x; 	| 	public static class B { 	} } 2. Place the cursor before the inner class (as shown above). 3. Invoke "Generate constructor using fields" and validate 4. The constructor is placed *after* the inner class (and with too many newlines): class Test { 	private int x; 	 	public static class B { 	} 	public Test(int x) { 		super(); 		this.x = x; 	} } More information: This occurs in 3.4M4 and also with 3.3.1.1
