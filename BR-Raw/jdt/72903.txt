Add variable expansion for Test Class in JUnit launch configurations [JUnit]

I reading the following description of bug 52028: <quote> Java Application and Java Applet launch config delegates should implement variable expansion on their Main Class and Project fields. This would allow generic launch configuration "templates" that support the re-use of common arguments in launch configs. There may be the need for contributed variables from Java and Applet plugins that support these variables. </quote> and I was wondering what it would take to implement this for JUnit launch configurations as well. It seems like it would be a very useful feature (at least, I know it would be for me) and it also seems like a logical extension of what has already been implemented. I've tried to see if it has already been implemented for JUnit launch configs and the ${java_type_name} variable doesn't seem to be accepted in the JUnit launch configuration Test class field (it says the test class does not exist and the run button is greyed out) when it is accepted for the Java Application Main Class field (no such error, run button enabled, and I'm able to run an application with it).
