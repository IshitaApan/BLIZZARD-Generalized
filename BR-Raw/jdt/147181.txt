[implementation] Incorrect use of instanceof TextSelection

In AbstractTextEditor, selectAndReveal is an if conditional that uses (selection instanceof TextSelection) I'm pretty sure you mean selection instanceof ITextSelection I discovered this while investigating bug 134047 which might have involved implementing ITextSelection with something other than TextSelection, and I was just seeing if any one mistakenly used cast or intanceof TextSelection :)
