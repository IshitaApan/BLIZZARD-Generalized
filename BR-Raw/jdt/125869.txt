[clean up][infrastructure] a dirty CU remains dirty, a clean CU is saved after the clean up

I20060125 + ZRH plug-ins from 20060131 - have this CU: public class Clazz { 	public void method() { 		String s= "234234"; 		String b= "asdf"; 	} } - save it (non-dirty) - use 'quick fix > clean up' to fix the NON-NLS warnings > note: the CU is saved after the clean up - alternatively: revert to the original state - dirty the CU by adding a space somewhere, e.g. after the package stmt - use 'quick fix > clean up' to fix the NON-NLS warnings > note: the CU remains dirty after the clean up I would expect the CU to be dirty in both scenarios, but perhaps I don't see all the consequences.
