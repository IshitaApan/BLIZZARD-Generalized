[quick fix] Foreach needs quick fix for type mismatch

Build ID: M20080221-1800 Steps To Reproduce: If the type of a variable declared in a loop is wrong, there should be a quick fix to change it to the right type, to be consistent with the behavior of Eclipse in other contexts. For example: ArrayList<String> myList = ... for (Integer val : myList|) { } This should offer the choice to change val to type String etc. See also bug 167472, it seems like there are no quick fixes implemented in the foreach context yet.
