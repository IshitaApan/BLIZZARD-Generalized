[refactoring] All extract refactorings and quick fixes fail with wildcard return type

N20050503-0010 All extract refactorings and quick fixes fail in examples with a wildcard return type: 	static ArrayList<? extends Number> al= new ArrayList<Integer>(); 	void test () { 		al.get(0); //<-select method invocation expression and extract 	} - Failing refactorings: Extract Local Variable, Extract Constant, Introduce Parameter, Extract Method - Failing Quick Assists: Assign statement to new local variable, .. to new field I think we should have one utility method with this fix, since all affected parties currently just use the import rewrite and get back a wildcard type from there. The correct declaration type for wildcards is: - the upper bound of the wildcard if it exists, - java.lang.Object otherwise
