[Navigator] Make ResourceListSelectionDialog API

build 20021115 Spawned off of bug 26223: "------- Additional Comment #6 From Erich Gamma 2002-11-16 17:59 ------- Once the Go To Resource action is retargetable, JDT UI can provide a customized dialog that filters out Java resources (*.java and *.class). To do so the ResourceListSelectionDialog should be surfaced as API and offer a filter."
