Move on type does not accept a move target

M2 testing 1. In the package explorer select type AssertTest (not the CU) 2. Refactor->Move 3. Select another type (e.g. ClassLoaderTest) The error message says: Element inside compilation units can not be used as targets for files, folders or comp. units This is a type and should be able to be moved into an enclosing type. Note that it might be good to have the name/signature of the element currently koved in the dialog title: E.g. Move 'org.junit.AssertTest' (or as a description)
