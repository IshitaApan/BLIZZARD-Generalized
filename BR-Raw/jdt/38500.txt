getters/setters: very confused by interface fields

20030604 strange things happen when you start generating getters/setters for interface fields: - dialog says you can make them 'private/protected/default' which is incorrect for interface methods (default makes some sense but the others do not) - even if you say 'private' it still generates 'public' - all interface methods are always 'abstract' so 'final' makes no sense - it will never compile -'synchronized' makes no sense either -nor does 'native'
