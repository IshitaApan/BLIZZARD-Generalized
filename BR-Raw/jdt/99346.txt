[refactoring] Move member type to new file adds enclosing type's type variables to static inner type.

I20050610-0010 - Have the code below - move member type to new file -> B2 is changed from a non-generic type to a generic type Expected: this should only happen if the inner type is non-static, as the inner type really does not have a reference to the outer's type parameter. Enhancement: even if the inner type was non-static, the reference could be made optional if there are not references from the inner type (similar to the optional 'enclosing instance field' name).
