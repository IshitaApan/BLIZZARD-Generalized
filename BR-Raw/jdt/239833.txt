[compiler] Odd compiler error message "Illegal modifier for the method ..."

I20080702-0939 public class Try { 	//Illegal modifier for the method Try.Try(): 	public synchronized Try(int a) { } 	 	//Illegal modifier for the method Try.Try(): 	public final static Try() { } 	 	//Illegal modifier for the method m.Try(): 	public volatile void m() { } 	 	//Illegal modifier for the field fField; only public, protected, 	// private, static, final, transient & volatile are permitted 	public synchronized int fField; } The errors for illegal modifiers on methods and constructors are a bit odd: - Range is the method & parameter list => Expected: The actually illegal modifier - Talk about method even for constructors - Would be nice if they listed the allowed modifiers (as in the error for fields)
