F1 help does nothing (1GETAYN)

F1 help doesn't seem to work in many of the JDT views or the Java text editor. Press F1 in outline, hierachy view, or a Java editor. Nothing happens. NOTES: EG (6/4/2001 10:35:44 AM) 	The help contexts for Views is missing in the IJavaHelpContextIds.java 	file. 	As a consequence they are also missing in the contexts_JDT.xml. EG (6/4/2001 10:24:22 PM) 	The display view is missing a help context ID. 	The search results view doesn't define a help context ID. 	The type hierarchy view doesn't define a context. EG (6/5/2001 3:43:50 AM) 	global actions in action sets don't have a help context id, e.g., 	 <action label="%DebugAction.label" pulldown="true" icon="icons/full/ctool16/debug_exc.gif" tooltip="%DebugAction.tooltip" class="org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugDropDownAction" toolbarPath="debug" id="org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugDropDownAction" helpContextId="debug_action_context"> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< </action> EG (6/5/2001 5:31:13 AM) 	see also 1GEUF4P: ITPJUI:WIN2000 - No Help on Refactoring wizards GDA (6/5/01 11:09:35 AM) 	Should add the context ids. 	This is a 1 line change for each context. 	Recommend move to candidates MA (6/6/01 6:45:35 PM) 	Refactorings have help context ids 	added for views 			public static final String SEARCH_VIEW= PREFIX + "search_view_context"; 			public static final String PACKAGE_VIEW= PREFIX + "package_view_context"; 			public static final String TYPE_HIERARCHY_VIEW= PREFIX + "type_hierarchy_view_context"; 			public static final String DISPLAY_VIEW= PREFIX + "display_view_context"; 	global actions are all very obvious what they do. suggest to not add help DM (6/20/01 4:33:45 PM) 	Verified against 0.125 - context help is there for the stuff described in this PR: 	- packages view 	- hierarchy view 	BUT: 	- Outline view will only show Workbench's help because we do not register help in the page 	- Java editor: standard text comes up 	- Search View: standard text comes up - might work once help files from workbench are ok 	Not fixed - moving to InBox - Deferred
