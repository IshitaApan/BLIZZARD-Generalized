Call Hierarchy should show root element in title

The Call Hierarchy is the only view which shows its input as root element. All other views (Search, Package Explorer, CVS Resource History, etc.) only show their input in the view title via ViewPart#setTitle(String). I think the Call Hierarchy should also follow this pattern and just add the current input to the title. The currently shown "declaration" node could the be removed, which makes the model cleaner (only one node type: method calls) and saves some horizontal screen space. Before: [Title:] Calls To Method - updateView() : void - ... + setCallMode(int) : void - ... + refresh() : void - ... Proposed change: [Title:] Calls to method 'updateView()' + setCallMode(int) : void - ... + refresh() : void - ...
