[rename][content assist] Allow content assist when performing rename refactoring

Build Identifier: 20100917-0705 Ideally I could use content assist during a rename refactoring as I normally do when adding a field to generate a standardized name. For instance, while adding a field of type ClassA, I can type "ClassA", space, then invoke content assist and choose the field name "classA". However, invoking content assist during rename refacoring does not function at all. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: see above
