Cannot resize window "Generate Javadoc" [javadoc]

It would be very helpful if (more) windows could be resized, like the Javadoc-dialog. It's so small that you can barely read the package-names on the second view, and you have to read the tooltips to be able to determine which package to select. As package-names tend to get rather long, I think many users will run into this issue...
