Fonts on Preference Pages

Eclipse 3.0 M6. The following preference pages do not inherit their font settings from their parent Composite. Of course, this could be by design, but I doubt it. You can see this by changing the Dialog Font preference (Workspace > Fonts) from the default, 8 points, to something big such as 16 points. Next time you open the preferences you'll see that most other pages respect the Dialog Font setting. The offenders are as follows: Java > Code Formatter 	- Preview text area. Java > Code Formatter (WIP turned on) 	- Preview text area. 	- Dialog that opens after Clicking the "Edit..." button. Java > Editor > Syntax tab 	- Preview text area. Java > Editor > Templates 	- Preview text area. Java > Work in Progress 	- The whole page. There are other preference page offenders in Platform and Team, for which I'll submit individual bug reports.
