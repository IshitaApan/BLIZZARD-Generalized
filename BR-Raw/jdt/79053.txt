Compare: Title not informative enough, when comparing methods from different compilation units

Eclipse I20041110 When comparing two methods (with the same signature) from two classes in the same package the title for both "panes" only shows "method() - project/folder/package". As the "order" (left->right) doesn't seem to be the order in which you selected the methods, but the order they apear in the package-explorer it's not possible to "see" which method is from which class, you must know it. -> When comparing methods from different compilation units the name of the compilation unit should be displayed in the title of the code pane.
