[hovering] @see method link in Javadoc doesn't work correctly if the method is in superclass

Consider the following 2 classes: public class ClassParent { 	public void foo1() { 	} } public class ClassChild extends ClassParent{ 	/** 	 * @see #foo1() 	 */ 	public void foo2() { 		foo1(); 	} } Steps to reproduce: 1) Open ClassChild and select method foo2 2) In the javadoc view, under the See Also section there is link to method foo1, click on foo1 link. The javadoc for ClassChild opens instead of the doc for foo1. Selecting foo1 in @see #foo1 in the Java editor shows the javadoc correctly in the javadoc view.
