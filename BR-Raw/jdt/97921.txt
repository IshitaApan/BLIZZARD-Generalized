[typing] CompilationUnitEditor.TabConvertor should use project dependent formatter settings

with 3.1 RC1, In the code formatter I set tab policy to spaces only, indentation size = 2, and tab size = 8. when I hit the tab key, 2 spaces are added to the line instead of going to an 8 space (tab) boundary.
