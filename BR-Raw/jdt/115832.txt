[build path] Can't uncheck export of source folder

build I20051102-1600 In order to test compiling JFace against a reduced subset of core.runtime, I: - changed the build path of org.eclipse.jface to include its runtime-util source folder - removed the plug-in dependencies classpath container - added o.e.core.commands and SWT as explicit projects On the Libraries tab, the runtime-util source folder is exported, and I cannot uncheck it, even though the check box is enabled. With this setup, downstream plug-ins complain about references to IProgressMonitor etc due to access restrictions from JFace. I do not want these plug-ins to see the ones in runtime-util. They should compile against the org.eclipse.core.runtime plug-in as usual. Expected behaviour: - The ability to uncheck export of the source folder.
