[correction] Quick Fix (Ctrl+1) takes a long time to catch up with current state

The Quick Fix feature (pressing Ctrl+1) takes a very long time to correctly display the list of options. If I use a new class which is not in the import list the unknown type shows up as an error. Pressing Ctrl+1 to show a quick fix menu oftens lags behind so that the 'import type' is not shown on the menu. This is highly annoying ans really slows down workflow. Sometimes it will not update until I do a Save on the file. Occasionally it refuses to do so until I quit and restart Eclipse. This happens frequently on a 2.5GHz HP PC with 1GB RAM even with Eclipse given 512MB. This is symptomatic of a general problem with Eclipse taking a long time before the syntax colouring of errors and warnings catches up to the current state of the editor.
