Editable Table: Key-navigation is bad [refactoring] [misc]

20031119 My expectations for table navigation and usages come from windows applications like MS Excel. The eclipse tables are not follow the 'look' but not the 'feel' and are in general very frustarting to use. 1. select a method and choose 'Refactoring > Change Method Signature' 2. Press 'Add'. A new line added, table cursor set to first field 3a. Press 'TAB'. The focus goes to the field. Press 'TAB' again: The add button gets the focus I would expect that the first TAB sets the table cursor to the next cell. 3b. Press 'cursor right'. Nothing happens. Press Enter first, press 'cursor right'. The next field gets the focus I would expect the first cursor right to focus on the next cell. 4b. With the next cell in focus, start typing. Nothing happens. Press Enter first, then you can type I would expect that entering should be possible right away.
