Different implementation of method override - ctrl+space vs Override/Implement method dialog [code manipulation]

I'm in a class that extends Wizard. Seems strange (wrong) to me that when I type "createp" and ctrl+space in the editor I get: public void createPageControls(Composite pageContainer) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub } But when I use the Source > Override/Implement Methods... to get the dialog and select createControl I get: public void createPageControls(Composite pageContainer) { // TODO Auto-generated method stub super.createPageControls(pageContainer); } Why no super in the ctrl+space generation of the overridden method? If by design it seems confusing by design (the inconsistency). This 3.0 behavior is consistent with what happens in 2.1 - but not sure if that means it is right. Feels wrong.
