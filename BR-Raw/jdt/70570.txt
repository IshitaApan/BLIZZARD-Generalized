Show Junit view on error preference totally broken [JUnit]

R3.0 The state of the Java > JUnit > "Show Junit results view only if errors or failures occur" has no effect at all i.e. the view opens whether this preference is checked or not (minor detail: if JUnit is a fast view then the pref seems to work). While this is not yet a major bug it unfortunately also affects whether the JUnit view's title (progress) gets updated: there's a missing ! and hence it does not update the title when I uncheck this preference. The only time when the icon update should not be done is when the JUnit view hasn't been created yet.
