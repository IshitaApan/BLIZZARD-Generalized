JVM crashes on method rename with circular dependecies in the classpath

I am reporting this bug for a WSAD customer. I have a simple scenario that will crash the Eclipse workbench. The key to making the crash happen seems to be that I need to have two projects whose classpath is dependent on each other with each dependency exported. I will attach two .zip files- each containing a Java Project that exhibit this behavior. Here are the steps to follow: - Unzip each of these projects into your workspace. - Start Eclipse - verify that IafConfigurationEJB is dependentent on IafConfigurationJAVA and vice versa inthe Java Build Paths page. Also notice that each dependendency is exported. - Open the com.deere.u90.iaf.configuration.ConfigurationPropertiesHelper class. In the Outline view, select the GetDefaultDirectory() method and select Refactor->Rename. Rename the method to GetDefaultDirectoryXX() and select the Next button. The JVM will crash and the Eclipse will come down. Note that if you remove the exports or the circular dependency, the crash does not occur.
