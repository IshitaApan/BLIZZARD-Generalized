TextEdits: Moved positions removed

20030625 See TextBufferTest.testMoveWithRangeMarker2 The RangeMarker is inside the MoveSource, and the MoveSource inside a delete: The resulting range of the Range Marker is deleted, not moved (TextBufferTest.testMoveWithRangeMarker shows that is works if there is no surrounding delete)
