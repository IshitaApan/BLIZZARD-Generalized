Initial use of Open Type gives no feedback for several seconds

build I20050426-1700 - switched to new build - used Ctrl+Shift+T - it appeared unresponsive for several seconds (though CPU usage went up), then the "Checking model consistency..." dialog came up and did work for a while - should bring up the dialog sooner, or show the busy cursor if this is not possible
