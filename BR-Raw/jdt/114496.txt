[working sets] working sets: counter-intuitive hiding of resource sets

3.2 M3 test pass ws= working set I guess this is part of the restrictions when using resource ws' in the pkg explorer... but this is really unintuitive: - create a resource ws 'Foo' containing one Java project - configure the pkg explorer to show ws' and to show 'Foo' > everything as expected - in the pkg explorer, select 'Foo', choose 'Configure...' from the ctx menu - add some resources (files, but not projects) from another Java project to the ws, press Ok > everything as expected - the working set shows the contained project, but not the files included above - in the pkg explorer, choose 'Select Working Sets...' from the view menu > expected: 'Foo' is among the available ws' < actual: 'Foo' is not in the list One effect of this is that I cannot remove 'Foo' from the pkg explorer now.
