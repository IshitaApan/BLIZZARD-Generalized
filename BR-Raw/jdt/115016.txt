[open type] Sort types with source first

The open type dialog currently sorts the proposals when there are multiple results in an odd order. I'm not sure what the ordering is, it seems to be somewhat random. It would be better if the results firstly listed hits directly from open projects, then from the libraries that have source attachements, and finally from libraries with no sources. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that the first hit on this list is also the type that gets opened by the debugger when opening items from the stack trace. This is particularly annoying when debugging because it means you can't easily follow the flow through the correct class. It may be good here to offer a flyout of different locations for the source when following these links, or at least resolve them with preference to the current project first, but even if the above reordering was used the correct class would be found more often rather than some class file introspection based stub.
