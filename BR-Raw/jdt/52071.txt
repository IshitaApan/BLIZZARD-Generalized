Cannot change default formatting preferences -- OK button disabled

I like the new options for the code formatter, but when I change them I am unable to click 'OK' as the button is greyed out when the preference window is opened and clicking checkboxes does not seem to un-enable it. I cannot change either the 'default' or 'Java' profiles (though I can create a new one and change that). I do not know if this is a bug or feature; but if it is a feature, I think a warning message should be displayed saying 'The default is not changeable' and it should not be possible to select any of the checkboxes, rather than not being able to commit the changes once they are made.
