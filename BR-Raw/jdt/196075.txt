[build path] Creation of a New Project Outside the Workspace is Incomplete

Problem Description ------------------- I separate my workspaces and codelines. In other words, my actual code and corresponding projects do not live directly in the workspace directory. Eclipse 3.2 allows the complete creation of a Java project outside the workspace. "Complete creation" means automatically specifying the pre-configured source directory (e.g., "src/java") and properly assigning the JRE System library to the project. Eclipse 3.3 does not seem to allow this. It creates the project structure outside the workspace, but does not automatically specify the pre-configured source directory and more importantly fails to assign the JRE System library. Steps to Reproduce ------------------ 1. Create a Java project (junk-3.3) that will not live directly in the workspace. 2. Choose the "Create project from existing source" option. In my environment, there is no directory called "junk-3.3". 3. Outside the workspace directory, create the junk-3.3 directory by pressing "Make New Folder." 4. Verify the fully qualified path in the Directory text box does not live under the workspace directory. 5. Press next. Normally my configured source folder "src/java" would appear under junk-3.3. It does not. However, my configured default output folder "ide-build" does automatically appear (I did not change it for this example). 6. Add "src/java" manually. Again, normally this would have been done automatically. If I don't add the source folder here, it doesn't get added to the project. 7. Press finish. The JRE System Library /is not added/ automatically. I have to add it manually. 8. Create a new project that will live in the workspace. 9. Press next. In my case, the pre-configured "src/java" source folder automatically appears, as well as the default output folder ("ide-build"). 10. The project is created. The JRE System Library /is added/ automatically.
