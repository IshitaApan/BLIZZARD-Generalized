Problem with linked folders, filters and refactoring.

I am trying to use the refactoring support in an environment where the project source tree is accessed via links and some parts of the raw tree are filtered out. Specifically I am trying to rename a class and when the refactoring dialog comes up I select all the options which forces a preview. When I select the "preview" button, the system works for a moment, flashes up another dialog or message box which disappears before it can be seen and finally presents a dialog that states that an internal processing error has occurred and that details will be found in the log. When I look at the log below !SESSION Jan 31, 2003 07:56:09.772 -------------------------------------------- - java.version=1.4.1_01 java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.

This is one of the directories that has been filtered out of the project. I am attaching the .project and .classpath files for the project as supporting material. Regards Jonathan Gossage
