Code formatter not obeying prefs

build i0609-1200 I have my code formatter settings set to put 0 lines before field declarations. I set this up a while ago (months). Template is available from the Core team web page. - When I upgraded to today's build and formatted code, it put spaces between field declarations. - I checked the prefs and it was still set to 0 spaces. - I changed it to be 1 space, hit OK then Apply then back to 0 spaces, and OK and Apply. -> formatting from this point worked ok Note that there were other things that didn't take effect until after the 2nd Apply including: - spaces in array element initializers - tabbing for switch/case statements
