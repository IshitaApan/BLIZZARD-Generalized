[preferences] Multiple requests for rebuild

Build: I20050509-2010 1) Open a new workspace 2) Create a Java project 3) Modify at least one preference on every "Compiler" preference page. 4) Click ok -> You are prompted to do a full rebuild for each page that has changed. If you changed three pages, you get three prompt dialogs. The user should only be prompted once. Even worse, all three or four builds are queued up and run one after the other. If you don't cancel the builds, the workspace is rebuilt several times.
