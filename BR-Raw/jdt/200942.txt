[dnd] Progress dialog flickers for invalid file drags to editor

Build ID: 3.4 M1 Steps To Reproduce: This bug can be reproduced using the UA Table of Contents Editor in M1. 1) Open an existing Help Table of Contents, or create one using New > Other... > User Assistance > Help Table of Contents. --> A TOC Editor should be open at this point. 2) Drag any file without an HTML or XML extension from the Package Explorer to the tree viewer of the TOC Editor. --> You should see the "drag not allowed" cursor as you move your mouse over the viewer. 3) Drop the file into the tree viewer. --> Bug: Even though the drop is not allowed, something is happening; there is a flicker of a progress dialog. Nothing should flicker or change, because this drop is invalid. More information: Debug tracing indicates that the class JdtViewerDragAdapter is notifying some listeners of the drag event, even though it did not succeed, and one of these listeners is firing a progress dialog. Attachment 76762 shows a screenshot of this progress dialog.
