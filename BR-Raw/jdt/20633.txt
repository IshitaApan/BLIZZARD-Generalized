inner "new interface" in a class - why option "static"? [code manipulation]

When you add an inner interface to a class or interface, the "new interface" dialog offers a checkbox "static". Wether an inner interface is static or not does not make a bit of a difference. So the main effect that checkbox is likely to have is, it confuses Java-newcomers. "Could you please tell me what this decision I have to make means?" (Nothing.) Get rid of that checkbox.
