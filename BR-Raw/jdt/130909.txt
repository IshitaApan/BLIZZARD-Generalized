[api][text edit] Need API on TextEditGroup to remove edits

ASTRewrite is currently spec'ed to handle multiple invocations to #rewriteAST(...) . If clients specify text edit groups during recording, ASTRewrite populates the text edit groups with the generated text edits during rewriting. Several calls to #rewriteAST therefore lead to lots of stale text edits which are still member of a text edit group. Apart from violating the specs of ASTRewrite, this also results in bug 130902. To solve this problem, methods are needed to remove text edits from an existing text edit group (which are already mutable objects). The following API is proposed: /** * Removes the given {@link TextEdit} from this group. * * @param edit the edit to remove * @return <code>true</code> if this group contained the specified edit. * @since 3.2 */ public boolean removeTextEdit(TextEdit edit) { return fEdits.remove(edit); } /** * Removes all text edits from this group. * * @since 3.2 */ public void clearTextEdits() { fEdits.clear(); }
