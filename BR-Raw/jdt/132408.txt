[Model Sync] Modify action provider to show open on compilation units

The Java action provider doesn't contribute an Open and Open with to compilation units. The menu items are contributed by the SynchronizationActionProvider superclass but the Java action provider is not enabled for ICompilationUnit. The same holds true for any file that is included in a Java project.
