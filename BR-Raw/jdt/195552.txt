[preferences] Code formatter prefs: "Force split" checkbox cut

N20070705-0010 Code formatter preference page > Line Wrapping: The "Force split" checkbox is cut in some scenarios. Steps: - profile dialog > Line Wrapping - in tree, select Class Declarations > 'extends' clause - Cancel - open profile dialog again - in tree, select Class Declarations => checkbox name is "Force split (" now (depending on your font) => expected: "Force split (2 of 2)" (like when you cancel/reopen with Class Declarations selected)
