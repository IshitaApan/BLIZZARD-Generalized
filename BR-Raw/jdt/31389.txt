Remove unused private fields - broken with >1 field/line

M5: Declare some variables like this: private int v1, v2; Use v2 in the code. (You might also have to turn on the compiler option to make unused fields a warning not ignored). Press ctrl-1 on the variable declaration line, select "remove". The whole line is removed even though v1 was the only unused variable.
