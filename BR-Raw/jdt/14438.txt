JarPackager support for setting comment on jar

Would it be possible to support setting a comment on jars? I'm more interested in doing this via the API than the UI. One approach would be to set something in the JarPackageData which the JarWriter can extract and call setComment() on the JarOutputStream. Alternatively, if the output stream were made accessible to subclasses of JarWriter, I could have my own writer handle this. The ability to set a comment is actually at the ZipOutputStream level, so maybe this needs to go even further down.
