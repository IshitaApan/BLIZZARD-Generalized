Move To Top Level:  incorrect this in constructor calls

Discovered at the same time as bug 24571 I tried the "move to top level" refactoring on a static inner class. The class constructors were migrated correctly to the new top level class. The constructor calls however had gained an extra "this" parameter. 1) There is a compile error becuse the constructors don't match up 2) There is no need to pass an explicit reference to the original enclosing class when moving a static inner class. Will attach the before and after classes. This also demonstrates the problem in bug 24571
