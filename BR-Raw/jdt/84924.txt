Move instance method should allow to move to declaring class

I20050209-0800 Move instance method should allow to move to the method's declaring class. I had code like this (somewhat more complicated, actually the method was a static method which I have moved to A): class A { void m(A a) { 	a.hashCode(); } } The refactoring didn't allow me to move A#m(A) to parameter 'A a'. I don't see why this is not allowed. Removing "&& !Bindings.equals(declaring, binding)" from MoveInstanceMethodProcessor#computeTargetCategories(..) worked fine (apart from an error message that a method 'm' already exists).
