[key binding] Some UI elements not reporting the correct keyboard shortcut for content assist

Build ID: I20070508-0800 Steps To Reproduce: PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getAdapter(IBindingService.class) not reporting the correct keyboard shortcut for content assist. As defined in org.eclipse.ui's plugin.xml, DBCS languages (zh, ja, ko) use "Alt+/" as the key sequence on gtk. A quick look at the code in one use case in Java editor shows that PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getAdapter(IBindingService.class) was called to get a list of bindings, then loop through to find the content assist command. However, "Ctrl+Space" is still reported on gtk in DBCS languages. Expected result: PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getAdapter(IBindingService.class) should return "Alt+/" as the key sequence on gtk in DBCS languages.
