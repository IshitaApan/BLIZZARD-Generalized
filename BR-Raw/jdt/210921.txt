[JUnit] RunListener testRunFinished not fired in Eclipse

Build ID: 3.3.1.1 Steps To Reproduce: I have written a custom Runner which can be used by @Runwith() In the runner I attach a runlistener. In that runlistener the 'testRunFinished' method is not called during a junit run form eclipse. 	public static void main(String[] args) 	{ 		 JUnitCore core= new JUnitCore(); 		 core.run(TestSuite.class); 	} When you do it in this way at the end the 'testRunFinished' is called, but running junit tests from Eclipse it is not called. I think this event is fired against the initial list of listeners, but I add this listener during the run, so it is not part of the initial listeners. I will attach some test files More information:
