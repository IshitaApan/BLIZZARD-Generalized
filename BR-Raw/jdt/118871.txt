[refactoring] Rename type with similar elements should match with plurals

I20051130-1215 The similar elements matcher could also handle the usual english plurals "" -> "s" and "y" -> "ies". class Item { // rename to Thing Item[] items; //not found, should rename to things Item[] item; //ok } The non plus ultra would be support for conversions like this: class Handy { // rename to MobilePhone java.util.Collection<Handy> handies; //-> mobilePhones Handy[] handy; //-> mobilePhone }
