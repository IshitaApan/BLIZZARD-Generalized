[filters] replace implicit rule for empty classpath containers with filter

Package Explorer view has an implicit rule that hides all empty classpath containers and jar folders like "Referenced Libraries". This rule is interfering with tools like Mylyn that applies its own task-focused filtering and even non-empty "Referenced Libraries" folder isn't shown when Mylyn filtering is on. One way to address this issue would be to replace implicit rule for "Referenced Libraries" and other empty classpath folders with an explicit filter. That filter will be visible in view menu / Filters... and also can be disabled/enabled by Mylyn using filter API.
