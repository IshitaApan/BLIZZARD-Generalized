Should show members of annotation types as public

I20041201 With the following annotation type: public @interface X { int foo(); int bar(); } the members foo() and bar() don't appear public, wherease with the following interface: public interface I { int foo(); int bar(); } the methods foo() and bar() appear public. JavaElementImageProvider#getMethodImageDescriptor(...) checks if the type is an interface. It should also check if the type is an annotation type.
