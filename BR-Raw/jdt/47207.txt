call hierarchy: Enablement of "Search Scope" item on view menu is wrong [call hierarchy]

At least on Windows NT/2000 this item is shown as disabled until the user clicks it it which case the submenu opens. I have been looking into this problem but without any results so far. Any suggestions are welcome.
