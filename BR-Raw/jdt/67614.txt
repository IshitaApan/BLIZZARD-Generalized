After "create field", additional text is inserted at multiple locations

I wrote the following method call: assertEquals(1.0d, blah(), delta); The field "delta" is not yet declared. I press Ctrl-1 and select "create field". The resulting line is: private Object delta; By typing the following sequence of keys: [Tab] double [Tab] [Right] = 0.0001d I change that manually to: private double delta = 0.00001d; Surprisingly, my original method call is now changed to: assertEquals(1.0d, blah(), delta = 0.00001d); And that is of course wrong. (BTW, I believe that the Ctrl-1 aid should guess the expected field type, but that's a different issue.)
