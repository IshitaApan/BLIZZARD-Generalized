Create inner subclass generate invalid import

When we have a class with an inner protected class like that, package test1; public class Parent { 	protected class Inner 	{ 	} } and an other one like that package test2; import test1.Parent; public class Child extends Parent { } and we want to generate a inner class in Child that extends the inner class Protected.Inner, we obtain package test2; import test1.Parent; import test1.Parent.Inner; public class Child extends Parent { 	public class Generated extends Inner 	{ 	} } but the import statement is not valid. It should not be generated.
