Method signature using QuickFix incorrect in static methods

Very Minor bug, When using quickfix to create method in an static anonymous inner class.. then the resulting method created is not static... but it needs to be. Example: 1. Create Class: public class SwingApplication { public static void main(String[] args) 	{ 		 		SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){ 			public void run() 			{ 				createGui(); 			} 			 		} 		); 		 	} } 2. Eclipse will give error that createGui() does not exist. 3. Use quickfix, and select 'Create method 'createGui()' in SwingApplication'. 4. Notice that the created method should be static...
