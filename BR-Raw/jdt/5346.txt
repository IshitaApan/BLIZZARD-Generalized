Debugger silently fails to prompt for source

20011025 Drop The debugger silently fails to bring up the source prompt dialog when the class file does not exist in the workspace. For example, I created Test.java in the filesystem public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { while(true) { System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis()); try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ie) { return; } } } } I ran in via the command line and the JDI debug flags. I started the 20011025 version of Eclipse and started a remote debug launch. The debugger connected to the VM. I clicked the main method and hit pause. I clicked "step out" to get out of the Thread.sleep(long) call. I then could not get the debugger to prompt me for source.
