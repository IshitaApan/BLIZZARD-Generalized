[hovering] Rich Problem Hover > Configure Problem Severity asks about project-specific settings too often

Created attachment 109891 .settings\org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs I20080812-0800 - create a Java project with the attached .settings\org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs - paste this class into the project: package p; public class C { 	void m(int arg) { 		if (arg == arg) { 			 		} 	} } - hover over 'arg == arg' - F2 - click Configure Problem Severity => dialog asks whether I want to configure project-specific settings => expected: no question, since the project already has project-specific settings The problem is that ProblemHover.ConfigureProblemSeverityAction.run() only checks whether there's a project-specific setting for the given problem ID, but the last time the *.prefs file has been updated, that option has not been available yet.
