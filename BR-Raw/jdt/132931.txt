Extract Local Variable incorrectly moves local variable outside non-delimited loop.

Given the method: 	private void test(Collection c) { 		for (Object o : c) 			System.out.println(o.toString()); 	} If you attempt to extract "o.toString()" as a local variable, it is placed outside the for loop. The refactoring should create braces for the for loop and place the local variable inside.
