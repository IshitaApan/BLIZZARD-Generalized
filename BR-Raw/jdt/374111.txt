[common navigator][package explorer] problem marker on package should not be repeated on parent package

With the fix for bug 372012 a missing @NonNullByDefault on any package (via package-info.java) is reported against the package, good. However, in the package explorer this marker is rendered twice: for the current package and for the parent package, e.g.: bug372012 package-info.java bug372012.p1 package-info.java bug372012.p1.p2 if the default is missing only in bug372012.p1.p2 two warning or error overlays are shown on packages bug372012.p1.p2 *and* bug372012.p1. This seems to correlate with the fact that problems in any CU are additionally rendered on the containing package, where it makes sense to make problems visible even if packages are shown collapsed. However, for a package propagating the overlay also to the parent is undesired.
