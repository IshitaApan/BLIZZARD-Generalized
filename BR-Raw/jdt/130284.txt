[quick assist] Remove curly braces / parenthesis QA accessability

3.2M5 The "remove curly brackets" (and "change 'if' block to statement") Quick Assists are difficult to access, because they are not available when the caret is to the right or left side of the brackets. It would make sense to have them available when the caret is on the right side of the bracket, which would be symmetrical to the matching bracket indicatior. The "remove parenthesis" Quick Assist is available when the caret is on the left of the opening or on the right side of the closing parenthesis, the former is not symmetrical to the matching bracket indicator.
