Double-quote as character value broken in RC1

There is a series of related bugs under the category of it's really hard to enter a character value containing a double-quote character and when you try it strange things can happen. 1. Single-quote balancing seems not to work at all. When you type a single quote you get a single quote. 2. When you type the character sequence '" the result is '"" (!) 3. When you try to backspace over the extra unwanted " (either the first or the second) both are erased. The only way to get the desired result seems to be to copy and paste the " character. 4. If you try to cut and paste in the ", you can get in some weird mode where the editor thinks a string exists where there is none. I'm still trying to figure out the sequence that produced the following lines: if (c == ''' || c == '"') {" + "} (Leading tabs removed for sake of example.) I only know that the last two " characters were not typed. No doubt another illustration why editor modes are a bad idea.
