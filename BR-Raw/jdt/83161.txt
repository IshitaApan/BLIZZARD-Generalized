Can't access public field from private subclass

Since I20050118 this code does not compile anymore. The access to 'publicField' is marked as 'not visible' public class A { 	private static class PrivateInner { 		public int publicField; 	}	 	public static class PublicInner extends PrivateInner {	 	} } class B { 	void foo(Object o) { 		A.PublicInner x; 		int i= ((A.PublicInner)o).publicField; 		int j= x.publicField; 	} } Also note the strange error range marked on the assignment to 'i'
