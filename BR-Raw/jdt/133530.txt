[javadoc location] validating location on typing very slow

20060328-0010 - In the configure javadoc location dialog, edit something like file://http://www.junit.org/doc - It takes several seconds until the user control is back I'm not sure if this is related top the special URL. The validation has been in for a long time. Maybe something changed with the new file system support. I think we probably have to remove the checking as you type.
