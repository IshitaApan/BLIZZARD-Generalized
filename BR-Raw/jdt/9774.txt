ProblemTreeViewer does not handle adaptable label updates

If a label update event comes to the ProblemTreeViewer whose element is an IResource the update does not occur as handleLabelProviderChanged (LabelProviderChangedEvent event)checks for an item by equality and does not handle the case where a resource is the element for an event but objects that adapt to resources are being shown. In the case of the ProbemTreeViewer java objects are being shown. When handleLabelProviderChanged the event element may be a resource which the regular TreeViewer would not find. ProbemTreeViewer will have to handle this case. This is currently an issue for the CVS Decorator as this it sends updates for a specific resource.
