[quick assist][quick fix] The order of quick fix/quick assists is wrong sometimes

N20110305-2000 Case 1 - (bug 332521 comment #10) -------- The fix still shows quick assists ahead of quick fixes sometimes : public class A { /** * blah blah * */ void boo(int ti){ } } 1. Have your compiler preferences set to warn/error out with missing/malformed Javadoc. 2. Ctrl +1 shows : a) Add all missing tags b) Assign parameter to new field c) Add '@param' tag d) Rename ... e) Rename.. ==> Shouldn't (c) come before (b) since it solves the problem and here since I clicked on a param I could also be looking for (c) rather than (a)? Test case 2: (from bug 334992 comment# 7) ----------- public class A { int foo(){ new StringBuffer(); return 1; } } => I would expect that the 'Return the allocated Object' quick fix comes before or after both the Assign quick assists.
