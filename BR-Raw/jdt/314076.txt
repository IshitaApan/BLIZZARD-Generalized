[rename] Incorrect message while 'Rename' when CU not on Build path

Build I20100520-1744 - New workspace - Open a Java file placed anywhere on the file system (but is not on build path) Use following snippet package q; public class B { int a; void foo() { System.out.println(); System.out.println(); } } - Select field 'a' OR method 'foo' - From the Menu bar 'Refactor' -> Rename => Dialog saying 'Operation unavailabe on the current selection. Select a field Java project, field, method.... etc' comes up. However dialog saying 'the CU is not on the build path' should come up.
