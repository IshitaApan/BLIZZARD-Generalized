Using uninitialized field instead of parameter in MethodStubsSelectionButtonGroup

The constructor of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.wizards. MethodStubsSelectionButtonGroup contains this line: if (fButtonsStyle == SWT.RADIO) { Since fButtonsStyle is not initialized from the parameter buttonsStyle at that moment, what actually was meant is this: if (buttonsStyle == SWT.RADIO) { BTW: I found this bug using the FindBugs plugin. Seems to be really useful.
