[content assist] field names in setters or constructors are not completed by content assist if to be qualified with this

From 3.1 on the "this" qualifier is suggested by code assistance when completing on field names that have the same name as constructor or method parameters. Unfortunately the field variable name is not succesfully applied when using the completion. In contrast to previous releases the qualifier appears in the completion list: key String this.key String - Test sample: public class Test { 	private String key; 	public Test(String key) { 		k // try completion here 	} 	 	public void setKey(String key) { 		k // try completion here 	} }
