[implementation] Deadlock in SharedASTProvider.getAST()  (on breakpoint creation)

Build Identifier: 3.6.0 final Similar to bug 310396 and bug 302581, this time I've got a deadlock while debugging by simply double-clicking on the vertical editor ruler. I will attach stack dump. As noticed in bug 302581 comment 3, usual pattern is to check a condition BEFORE calling .wait() method on an object. This time as the UI requested the AST, UI thread got blocked forever, so nobody can call notify()... Reproducible: Always
