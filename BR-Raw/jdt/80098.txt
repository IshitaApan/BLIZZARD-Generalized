newTypeHierarchy(IRegion,...) should not be constrained to an IJavaProject

As Dirk has discussed with Philippe and Jerome, we need API to build a supertypes hierarchy on an arbitrary IRegion that crosses project boundaries. This API is required for the new implementation of the RippleMethodFinder. Currently, IJavaProject has methods newTypeHierarchy(IRegion, IProgressMonitor) newTypeHierarchy(IRegion, WorkingCopyOwner, IProgressMonitor) , whose Javadocs promise exactly that. The only sore point is that these methods have to be called on an IJavaProject, and it is not clear to me what the role of the receiver project is. If the methods don't depend on the receiver project, then the methods should be moved to JavaCore. If they do depend, then - that dependency should be explained in the methods' Javadocs, and - we request new methods on JavaCore which build the supertypes hierarchy on types from an arbitrary IRegion.
