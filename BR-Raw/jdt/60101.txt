Sort by parent path should take method name into account

build i0420:0800 - I do a Java Search and sort the results by Parent Path - I believe the secondary sort consideration should be the method name - this would make the results sorted alphabetically Here are the currently results. Note I removed part of the package name to make the list clearer. (#addChild is out of order alphabetically) I'm not sure what order its listed in...#addChild is at the beginning of the java file so its not by order of appearance in the file. preferences.EclipsePreferences.childrenNames() preferences.EclipsePreferences.getChild(String) (2 matches) preferences.EclipsePreferences.getChildren() (2 matches) preferences.EclipsePreferences.removeNode(IEclipsePreferences) (4 matches) preferences.EclipsePreferences.addChild(String, IEclipsePreferences) (3 matches) preferences.RootPreferences.getChild(String) (2 matches)
