Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a Java project 2. Inside the source folder, create a package "fefe" (You'll have a folder "project/src/fefe" on disk now) 3. Create a normal folder "project/fefe" at the same level as the source folder 4. In the package explorer, select both the fefe folder and the fefe package 5. Right-click delete the selection. You'll be asked if you are sure that you want to delete 2 resources. Hit "Yes" 6. Notice that only the fefe package was deleted. The fefe folder still exists.
