conver to new for loop quick assist: variable name proposals should include inserted name and standard proposals

I20050509-2000 (M7 test pass) class X { 	void m(StringBuffer[] arr) { 		for (int i= 0; i < arr.length; i++) { 			StringBuffer myName= arr[i]; 		} 	} } - invoke quick assist, convert to new for loop - you get this, as expected: 		for (StringBuffer myName : arr) { 		} < actual: Linked mode is set up, proposing additional names for the local variable {element, e} > expected: - the chosen variable name ('myName' in this case) is also offered as choice; it should be ranked first, such that pressing <Return> simply advances without changing the document. - the standard variable name proposals ({buffer, stringBuffer} in this case) are also proposed; IMO they should rank before the general {element, e} proposals.
