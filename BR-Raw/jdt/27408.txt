Preference convertor also maps to font registry

20021126 If you set the Java Editor font the text editor font in the workbench preference store is also set. This does not appear to affect the font registry (i.e. the correct font is used in text editors) but it will show up as changed in the preference page. STEPS 1) Open a text editor 2) Set the Java editor font 3) Text editor does not change 4) Open the fonts preference page 5) The text font will have the value of your java editor font. One solution for this is to switch to the new font propogation support. See Bug 27402.
