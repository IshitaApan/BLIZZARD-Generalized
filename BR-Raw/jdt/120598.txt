Refactoring History JAR Export Wizard should allow (de-)selecting refactorings

I20051213-0010 It is currently not possible to deselect single refactorings from the history during the export of a JAR - only refactorings before a certain date can be excluded. I'd suggest adding the possibility of selecting/deselecting refactorings.
