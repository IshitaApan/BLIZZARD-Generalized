[misc] LineTrackerPerformanceTest is run twice while running jdt.text performance tests

LineTrackerPerformanceTest is defined both in PerformanceTestSuite and DocumentPerformanceTestSuite test suites. As test.xml launches both of these test suites, LineTrackerPerformanceTest is run twice during JDT/Text performance tests. I do not know if this is really intentional, but currently the performance framework does not really support this kind of pattern while computing the tests statistics. See StatisticsSessions line 160: stats.stddev= stdevSum / aggregateCount; // XXX this does not work! have to treat multiple runs like normal measurement data I also agree that this does not work and so, until this bug is fixed in the performance framewotrk, such duplicate run should be avoided...
