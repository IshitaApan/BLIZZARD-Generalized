[breadcrumb] Breadcrumb does not honor package name abbreviation setting

Created attachment 187397 proposed patch - It is useful to see the abbreviated package names in all java viewers - less information to parse. - If the editor is not maximized, quite often some labels in the breadcrumb are hidden. Abbreviating the package names a little in reducing the length of the breadcrumb. Markus, is there any reason to not do this? (In Bug 329677 we had fixed the same problem in other places, but I do not recall if we missed to fix breadcrumb or it was deliberate)
