"Encapsulate Field" changes the data type of member variable [refactoring] [sef]

Eclipse Version: Version: 3.1.0 Build id: 200412162000 Create this simple class in eclipse - public class TestEncapsulate { 	String a, b; } 1) Select the Field a 2) Right-click and select Refactor -> Encapsulate Field. 3) Click Ok. 4) The following code is generated - public class TestEncapsulate { 	String b; 	private int a; 	/** 	 * @param a The a to set. 	 */ 	void setA(String a) { 		this.a = a; 	} 	/** 	 * @return Returns the a. 	 */ 	String getA() { 		return a; 	} } Problems a) The field was changed to a private field even though it was package-private earlier. b) The data type was changed from String to int!!! The encapsulate field works fine when there is only one field delared in one line (String a;) It breaks in the above code for both fields 'a' & 'b'.
