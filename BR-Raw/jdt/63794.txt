NLS Search reports bogus match ranges [search]

M9 1) Do an NLS search with org.eclipse.search.internal.ui.SearchMessages and the SearchMessages.properties file in the same package 2) Observe: you get 116 unused keys reported, but there are two problems: a) you get an internal error dialog b) when I fixed the internal error (its' an error trying to log a BadLocationException), I noticed that we get loads of bogus match positions for unused keys in SearchMessages.properties. It seems that the method that looks for the position of an unused property key doesn't handle the case where the key is not found.
