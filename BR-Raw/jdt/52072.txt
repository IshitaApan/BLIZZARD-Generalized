Code formatter -> white space -> control statements -> do while shows while example

The formatting options for the 'do while' statement shows an example of a 'while' loop rather than a 'do while' loop. Seems odd; either the option should be 'while' or the preview should show a do-while loop. Mac OS X.3.2 Eclipse 3.0M7
