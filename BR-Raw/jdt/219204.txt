[clean up] Remove static accesses through instances may remove code with side-effects

Make sure Member Accesses --> Change all accesses through instances is selected for Clean Up. Consider the following example: package org.example; public class Thing { 	public static void main(final String[] args) { 		Thing.returnThing().returnThing().returnThing(); 	} 	public static Thing returnThing() { 		return new Thing(); 	} } Running Clean Up reduces this to (Note the missing returnThing() invocations.) package org.example; public class Thing { 	public static void main(final String[] args) { 		Thing.returnThing(); 	} 	public static Thing returnThing() { 		return new Thing(); 	} } thus removing valid code. I ran into this while using commons-cli's BuildOption and Clean Up completely broke my program.
