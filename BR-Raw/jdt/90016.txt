[typing] Several errors when display tab with set to 0

Eclipse Java Development Tools Version: 3.0.2 Build id: 200503110845 Hi to all and thank for the tool, very nice work. :) I start Eclipse. I open one of my java file under my only open project. (3 closed) I expand the following. -->private DefaultTableModel tableModel = new DefaultTableModel() { public boolean isCellEditable(int rowIndex, int mColIndex) { return false; } 	// Returning the Class of each column will allow different 	// renderers to be used based on Class public Class getColumnClass(int column) 	 { 		 return getValueAt(0, column).getClass(); 	 } }; I select the following line and I copy it CTRL-C: " 	// Returning the Class of each column will allow different" I set my cursor before the following line: " public boolean isCellEditable(int rowIndex, int mColIndex)" And I hit CTRL-V. (for pasting.) And I have this error poping up: ________________________________________________ | Error Executing Command | |________________________________________________| | The command for the key you pressed failed | | | | Reason: | | / by zero | |________________________________________________| Thanks for your time. If you have any other questions, let me know. Keep in mind that in other place on the same file, copy and paste work fine, it's only at specific place. Ciao, Fran√ßois.
