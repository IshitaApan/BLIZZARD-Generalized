[build path] "compiler settings changed" dialog appears multiple times

If compiler settings are changed on more than one preference pane (e.g., on "Java Compiler", "Building", and "Errors/Warnings"), and the user clicks OK, the Compiler Settings Changed dialog will then appear once for each modified preference pane. This is the dialog that asks "A rebuild of the project is required for changes to take effect. Build the project now?". It is not clear what the effect is, if the user answers "no" to the question on one of the dialogs and "yes" on another. It is also not clear whether multiple build jobs are actually being submitted. I expected to only see the pane appear once per click of OK, rather than once per modified pane.
