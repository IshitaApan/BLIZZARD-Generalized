TVT3.0: Add Constructor from Superclass has incorrect mnemonics

Open a Java Project, call it java-project. Select java-project in the left pane. On the menu bar from the main Workbench panel, click File > New > Others Select Class Click Next In the Name put java_project_class Click Finish On the menu bar from the main Workbench panel, click Source > Format Select Add Constructor from Superclass == > The way to show the mnemonic is incorrect for Traditional Chinese. It should be shown as below. public -> public(P) protected -> protected(T) private -> private(V) This is inconsistent with the other mnemonics. All the others display as string1(X) and string2(Y). Public, Protected, and Private need to follow the same model. The translator cannot find the strings &public, pro&tected, or pri&vate in her Translation Memories. So our guess is, these strings have not been externalized. If they have, could you provide the path to the file that they are in. See the attached screenshot
