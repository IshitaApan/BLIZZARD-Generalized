open type: no progress should be shown if no searching is done

there used to be no progress monitor dialog in the 'fast access' mode (when stuff was actually in the cache and no searching was done) now, i see the progress monitor everytime which makes no sense (takes more time to open the PM dialog then the type dialog) and it looks extremally flashy
