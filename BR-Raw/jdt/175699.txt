"Javadoc could not be found" message if source file exists but member has no Javadoc

HEAD (with fix for bug 175459) - Open java.lang.Object - Hover over registerNatives() => Message is: ---------------------------------------------------- void java.lang.Object.registerNatives() Note: The Javadoc for this element could neither be found in the attached source nor the attached Javadoc. ---------------------------------------------------- => Expected: Just the signature without a message. This would be in line with what's shown for source methods without Javadoc. The message should only be shown if the source attachment contains no java/lang/Object.java file at all.
