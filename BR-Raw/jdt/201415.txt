Refactoring asks to save on non-resource related editors

3.3 Some rename refactorings (rename project, folders) and all move refactorings (move folder, move file) prompt to save all dirty editor as they want to make sure that no editor has a file open that is going to be moved. All other editors only save non-Java resources (bug 175495) We should not save editors that are not resource related. Launching solved that problem by testing if a editor input adapts to IResource. (bug 114093).
