Java Editor 'Show In > Package Explorer' beeps even when element selected [package explorer]

200406180010 Open a Java editor and choose 'Navigate > Show In > Package Explorer'. The Package Explorer is shown and the right element is selected. Nevertheless, there's a Display#beep() which should only occur when the element could not be shown. The problem is that PackageExplorerPart#revealAndVerify(..) sets the selection (converting the given editor input file into an IJavaElement) and then compares the new selection to the given file to determine success. This test obviously fails when the selection is not a file but a CU. That's why the beep is issued.
