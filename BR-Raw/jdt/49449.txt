Extract Constant Refactoring: remember 'qualify constant' state [refactoring]

It would be useful if the state of the 'Qualify Constant references...' checkbox was remembered between invocations of the extract constant refactoring. Better yet, determine what the state of the checkbox should be based on where the extracted literal is extracted from. ie., if its in a static block/method, then the checkbox is unchecked, if its in an instance method, then its checked.
