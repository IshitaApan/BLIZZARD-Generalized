[Dialogs] Space usage of type info cache

build I20021127 While looking at some other performance issues (see bug 20844), I noticed that doing an Open Type generates 15410 instances of org.eclipse.jdt.internal.corext.util.TypeInfo and 15410 instances of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.FilteredList$Label. The labels go away when the dialog is closed, but the TypeInfos do not. The Open Type dialog takes a fair bit of time just to generate the Labels, despite not displaying anything until the user starts typing. It took 17 seconds to open the dialog when running under OptimizeIt, not using JIT, on my 2GHz machine, in a self-hosting workspace containing Core and UI in source, and the rest in binaries. For the common case of the user entering a prefix, would it not be possible to just go directly to the indexes, rather than building a type cache? Kent mentioned some ideas for improving indexing which might make this possible.
