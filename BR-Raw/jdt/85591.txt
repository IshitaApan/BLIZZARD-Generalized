[preferences] indexOutOfBoundsException in the Text Editors preference page on loss of selection

I20050215-2300 The native widget used by List (and Table and Tree) on Linux-GTK supports typeahead via a floating entry, which can be triggered using Ctrl-F, or by simply typing in the list on newer versions of GTK+. Using this typeahead feature, single-selection lists can lose their selection when the user types in a prefix that is not found in the list. When this occurs, a selection event is sent, and the current index in the List is -1. See bug 85590. This difference causes an IndexOutOfBoundsException in the Text Editors preference page when typing in the "Appearance color options:" list. The cause is this code in TextEditorDefaultsPreferencePage which does not check for -1 from getSelectionIndex(): 	foregroundColorButton.addSelectionListener(new SelectionListener() { 		public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e) { 			int i= fAppearanceColorList.getSelectionIndex(); 			String key= fAppearanceColorListModel[i][1];
