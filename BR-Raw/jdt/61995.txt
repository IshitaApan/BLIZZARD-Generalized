Removing search matches is slow

I20040512 - 0800 1) Search for declarations of "toString()" in a self-hosting workspace with core projects (or some equivalent search). -> Finding 861 matches takes about 20 seconds. Great 2) Click "Remove all Matches" -> Instantaneous 3) Repeat the search 4) Select every search result but one, and push the delete key -> Deleting 860 matches takes 52 seconds. I did a bit of profiling, but all the time is inside a WindowProc - it looks like table removal is very slow.
