[refactoring] Rename field Preview dialog misplaced on desktop, is overlaid by Dock

MacOS 10.4.1, OS X Dock set to right edge of primary screen (I work with two Eclipse windows - one on the main laptop screen, and one on a separate monitor to the left of the main laptop screen). In a Java source file select a field, preferably one mentioned in comments to force a Preview below. Select Rename... from Refactor menu to get the Rename Field dialog. Change field name and click on Preview button. The Rename Field (preview) dialog shows up on the main laptop screen but is too low on the screen by about the height of a window title bar - this leads to the Preview >, Cancel and OK buttons being clipped by the bottom edge of the screen. The right edge of the dialog lies under the Dock on the right of the screen. Note also that, even though the Rename Field (preview) has a working resize icon on the lower right, it does not have a green resize "gumdrop" (whatever it's called) in the upper left (on the title bar). Having the green resize gumdrop would be a quick fix for whenever the Rename Field (preview) dialog was misplaced - normally in most Mac apps clicking the green gumdrop maximizes the window/dialog - allowing for the Dock, of course.
