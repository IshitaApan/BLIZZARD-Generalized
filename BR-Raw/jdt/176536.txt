[rename] rename of a package should add imports to classes in the package for types in the same package included from jars

To reproduce: - create 2 java projects AProj and BProj - in AProj create an interface IFace in a non-default pkg - export AProj to a jar (AProj.jar) - add AProj.jar in the build path for BProj - in BProj create a new Class that implements IFace in the same pkg as IFace - in BProj rename the package - the import for IFace should be added to the implementation since the interface and the implementation are now in different packages.
