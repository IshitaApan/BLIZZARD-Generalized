[JUnit] JUnit View actions missing or not working for JUnit tests which are inner classes

hi, if you have unit tests which are inner classes, then some JUnit View actions are missing or not working. Specifically, (1) if the inner class unit test is wrapped as a suite, then the 'run suite' option in the context menu on the suite element does not appear (2) in the same situation as above, if you right-click on an individual test an re-run it, you get an error dialog saying "Test type does not exist" thanks, Andrew ps. the reason I'm using inner classes is that I need a core set of tests run twice in different setup scenarios. The tests depend on accessing configuration information, and so test decorators are not a suitable mechanism.
