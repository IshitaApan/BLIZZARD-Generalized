QuickFix Add catch clause to surrounding try in catch clause incorrect [code manipulation] [refactoring]

With the following code in the editor: try{ someMethod(); //throws SomeException }catch(SomeException e){ someOtherMethod(); //throws SomeException } You will get a QuickFix that suggests to add a catch clause to the surrounding try. There is no surrounding try. It will add another catch(SomeException e) to the try clause above! This catch clause is unreachable (which the editor notices). The exception is still uncaught (which the editor doesn't notice). Build: 2.1-M5
