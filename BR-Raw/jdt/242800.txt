[JUnit] Make importing JUnit results from the workspace easier

Created attachment 108910 New import wizard The current JUnit test result import requires you to use an OS based file picker to find the results you want importing. It would be nice if there was a workspace browser that could be used to pick the files too. I have attached a patch that adds a new import JUnit test result import wizard and hooks into this wizard from the JUnit view. This is a prototype only and could do with a bit of cleanup. In particular, i was wondering if it would make sense to change it into more of a preview based wizard. Instead of having options to select a file or workspace resource, have one combo with two browse buttons and use the area underneath to show test summary data. This way we can verify that the file is indeed a test result file and verify it is the correct one.
