[refactoring] [extract method] Pre/post-increment/decrement in loops allowed to be extracted

Try an extract method refactoring on the following code, indicated by the comments: import junit.framework.TestCase; public class BugTest extends TestCase{ 	 	 public void testLoop(){ 		int x = 0; 		 		for (int i = x; i < 10; i++) 			//extract here... 		 assertEquals(i,x++); 			//...to here 	 } } If the refactoring were behavior preserving, the test should pass after the refactoring.
