[preferences] Code folding has completely disappeared

I do not know how I got my platform into this state but it has been like this for awhile and I cna't figure it out. I have completely lost all ability to use and even see code folding, even though the actions and preference settings all seem to think it is still there and working/available. I can enable and disable folding, and I see my editor margin increase/decrease in size providing a gutter for the code folding markers to appear in, but they simply aren't there. Also, all of the menu options to expand all and collapse all are there and enabled but they do nothing. I'll attach a bunch of screenshots and my platform configuration info. Things of note: I am running Eclipse 3.2 on Windows XP, and my workspace is set up for feature-based self-hosting.
