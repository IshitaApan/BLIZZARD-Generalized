[1.5][search][annot] search for annotation elements incorrect match range

When searching for references for the following annotation: public @interface Expected { 	Class value(); } The match range for a use of this annotation is as follows: @Test <|>@Expected(Error.class) public void expectedException() { This is confusing since when the editor doesn't have focus the caret isn't shown and therefore the match isn't visible.
