APT uses a lot of memory

This bug is a follow-on to bug 262791, which discussed slow compilation times. Customers complain of running out of memory when compiling large projects with APT enabled. The memory requirement is almost certainly because APT requests, and keeps references to, the ASTs of every type being compiled. This is necessary because processors can request information from any type, including in particular types that cannot be generated due to compilation errors. The JDT makes it so that bindings obtained in different requests are not comparable, so we have to make one big request, do all the processing, and then finish. It is not at all clear how to get around this while maintaining correctness. Possibly we could define a stripped-down version of the AST that contained only enough information for APT to act on; or, maybe we can find a way to reduce the number of ASTs we hang onto. This bug will serve as an umbrella for this investigation.
