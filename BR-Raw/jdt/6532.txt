Templates - Insert variable -- popup doesn't disappear

Window/Preferences/Java/Templates: Once one clicked on the "Insert variable" button one cannot make the popup window disappear without clicking on the "pattern" TA. Even when I switch to another application the window stays open! The window should disappear once the user clicks outside the popup window and/or changes (-> loss of focus) to another application. @@@@ Sebastian Davids
