Message in "Add New Source Folder" wizard doesnt expand "relative to"

Create a new Java project from an Ant build file. A Java project with source folder is created. Select the project and choose contextmenu > New > Source Folder. The message in the Wizard says: Add a new source folder relative to "{0}" Where {0} is apparently not expanded. Detail info: The project I tried to set up was for jakarta oro 2.0.8 src, downloaded from http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_oro.cgi I had downloaded the ZIP and extracted to a location outside the workspace, then simply created the Java project form the ANT build.xml target "jar"
