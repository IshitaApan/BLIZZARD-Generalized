Search in Hierarchy does not find Declarations in supers

20011206 - (happened to be on Windows2000) - Open an editor on a class that is in a deep hierarchy (I was in List in the SWT Widget hierarchy) - In the Outline view, select a method that has a declaration in several classes in the hierarchy (I selected createScrollBar(int) - this method is defined in Scrollable and redefined in List) - Context menu -> Declarations -> Hierarchy - It only found the method that was defined in List, and it missed the one that is defined in Scrollable (super of List) I notice that if you select the method (createScrollBar(int))in the superclass (Scrollable) and search for declarations in the hierarchy, it will find all of the methods. So I suspect that the search algorithm is only looking "down" for declarations, when it needs to look "up" as well.
