Cannot apply Surround with Try Catch when click error from task view. [refactoring]

Create a Java class say TestClass import java.net.URL; public abstract class TestClass { 	public static void main(String[] args) { 		new URL("http://www.ibm.com"); 		 	} } Now save it & close it, note the error in Task view Kind	Status	Priority	Description	Resource	In Folder	Location Error			Unhandled exception type MalformedURLException	TestClass.java walkthrough/JavaSource	line 6 Now double click on the error, it opens the file and selects/highlights the text 'new URL("http://www.ibm.com");' so I right click on the selection and choose Source->Surround with Try/Catch. But I get the message saying 'Only statements can be surrounded with try/catch block' This is incorrect behavior and confuses user because the statement was selected/highlighted when I performed the action. Infact if I re-select the statement in the exact same way, I can successfully perform Surround with Try/Catch giving import java.net.MalformedURLException; import java.net.URL; public abstract class TestClass { 	public static void main(String[] args) { 		try { 			new URL("http://www.ibm.com"); 		} catch (MalformedURLException e) { 			// TODO Auto-generated catch block 			e.printStackTrace(); 		} 		 	} }
