create getter/setter - getter javadoc text [code manipulation]

The getter javadoc says: /** * Gets the name. * @return Returns a string */ It should be: /** * Returns the name. * @return returns the name */ I'm not sure about the second line, but I feel strongly about the first line. Also, I think the param lines should start with lower case letters.
