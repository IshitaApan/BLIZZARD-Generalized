[reorg] cannot move folder into folder of non-java project [refactoring]

Cannot move folder into a folder inside a non-java project with ReorgMove. The move dialog only shows the simple project, without any children. Reason: StandardJavaElementContentProvider#getChildren(..) doesn't return children of an IProject. PackageExplorerContentProvider#getChildren has special code, which explains why children of non-java projects are visible in the Package Explorer: 			if (parentElement instanceof IProject) 				return ((IProject)parentElement).members(); 				 In StandardJavaElementContentProvider#getChildren(..), ... 			if (element instanceof IFolder) 				return getResources((IFolder)element); ... should be changed to ... 			if (element instanceof IContainer) 				return getResources((IContainer)element);
