[1.5] class file with "1.4 compatibility" cannot be run in Java 1.4

If I compile a simple class in Eclipse with the following compliance settings, it won't run in a 1.4 JVM. It appears the .class file relies on 1.5 libraries, despite the compatibility setting. Compiler compliance: 1.5 Generated .class compatibility: 1.4 Source compatibility: 1.5 Here's my source code: public class TestConcat { public static void main(String[] args) { String w = "world"; System.out.println("Hello " + w); } } The resulting exception: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/StringBuilder at TestConcat.main(TestConcat.java:13)
