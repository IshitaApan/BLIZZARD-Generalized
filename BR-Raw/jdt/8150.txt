Override methods dialog is too long

The Override methods dialog takes up the entire depth of the screen in Windows Standard Extra large. This is acceptable but if it doesn't need to be this large it should be reduced in size. STEPS 1) Create a class that implements java.sql.Statement 2) Select Override Methods from the Outline View 3) Very long dialog opens
