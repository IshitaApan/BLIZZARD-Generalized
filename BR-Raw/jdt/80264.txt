[search] Search for method declarations in workspace, disregarding declaring type

For the new RippleMethodFinder, we need to search for all declarations of a given method signature in the workspace. This search should *not* take the declaring type into account, only the signature must match. The current behaviour of search for method declarations of an IMethod in workspace does not make much sense, since it is exactly the same search as when searching in the hierarchy of the declaring type. Therefore, I think that search for method declarations in workspace should be changed to only consider the method signature of a given IMethod, and not its declaring type. Note that a string pattern search does not help here, since it only takes strings as parameter types, but we need the real type reference in the method parameters.
