Rename method complains if the new name is overloaded [refactoring]

Build: 20020321 Description: I have two methods that are supposed to have the same name: public Word computeSuccessorTo(Word word) public Word computerSuccessorTo(ILetterNode letterNode) I noticed that I had misspelt the name of the second method (there shouldn't be an r after compute) so I tried to use the rename function in the refactor menu. It complained that my class already had a method named computeSuccessorTo with the same number of parameters. The complaint is correct, but it isn't a problem since the arguments are of different types. If I ignore the errors and press Finish, the results are correct.
