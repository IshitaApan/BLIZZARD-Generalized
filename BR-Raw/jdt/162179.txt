Cannot edit a class using Open Type dialog after having loaded source of a plugin

Build I20061017-0800. I have opened an editor on JavaElementLabels class when org.eclipse.jdt.ui was not loaded in my workspace => Editor was opened on JavaElementLabels.class file using source attachement... Everything was fine. After that, I checked-out org.eclipse.jdt.ui plugin from CVS repository. Editor was closed automatically during this operation and so I wanted to open the editor on this class again. Then, I systematically got following error: "Unable to create editor ID org.eclipse.jdt.ui.ClassFileEditor: The classfile is not on the classpath" and so, I was not able to open an editor on this class... It seems that Open Type dialog history stored the previous path to class file and the only way for me to open the file was to explicitely remove JavaElementLabels from the history...
