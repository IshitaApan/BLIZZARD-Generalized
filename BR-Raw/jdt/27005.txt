[typing] Smart string wrapping

Using1119, I noticed something quite annoying. Consider the following code: String s = ""; If you copy some code like: class A { // comment } And then you paste it between the double-quotes, you will end up with: 	String s = "public class A { // comment" + 		"}"; The problem is that this code is not equivalent. I should have a line break at the end of the first line. Otherwise the code contained in my string s doesn't even compile. So the feature is nice, but cannot be used till a line break is added at the end of each part of the string concatenation. So in the above example, I would expect: 	String s = "public class A { // comment\n" + 		"}"; or 	String s = "public class A { // comment\r\n" + 		"}"; or 	String s = "public class A { // comment\r" + 		"}"; The line break could be chosen according to the line breaks in the current file or the platform line delimiter.
