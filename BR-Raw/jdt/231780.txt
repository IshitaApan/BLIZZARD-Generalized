[jar exporter] JAR Export should use a buffered output to gain speed

the jar exporter writes the generated jar byte by byte to the filesystem. (verified using sysinternals File Monitor) This is less of a problem when using a local harddisk but makes exporting to network drives unneccesarily slow. Reccomendation : use a BufferedWriter in the export code.
