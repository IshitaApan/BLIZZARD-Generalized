F2/Hover for external javadoc does not work

Eclipse 3.1M6 (I20050401-1645): F2/Hover shows only the signature for methods/fields in libs with external docs. Shift+F2 opens the correct page in the web browser, however, this it is quite annoying to switch back and forward between eclipse and the browser. So there is probably a lookup bug ... I'm not sure, whether it is related: When I configure the external docu (e.g. http://dev/java/stax/api/ ) and press the "Validate..." button, I get a " Unhandled event loop exception Reason: protocol = http host = null " However, Shift+F2 works ... I guess, the hover stuff does not use external docs at all. I've changed the docs settings for all JRE System Library from http://java.sun.com/... to http://dev/java/jdk-1.5/docs/api/, however, I do not see any access to those files in the apache logs ...
