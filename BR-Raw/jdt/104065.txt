[quick fix] No Quick Fixes for marker with IMarker.LINE_NUMBER and no IMarker.CHAR_START and IMarker.CHAR_END

I'm creating (problem) markers for a java file and I only have a line number available when I create the marker. I add the IMarker.LINE_NUMBER attribute to the marker attributes, but do not specify a CHAR_START or CHAR_END. The marker shows up in the file, but there are no Quick Fixes available for it (using Ctrl+1 or right click on the marker). When I click on the marker in the problems view, however, I get the quick fixes that are possible. (This used to work in 3.0, doesnt now in 3.1) I traced through the code and found that the markers with a line number get their end and start range set to be the same in: AbstractMarkerAnnotationModel.createPositionFromMarker(IMarker marker). Because the start and end are both -1 coming into the method, end = start. In JavaCorrectionAssistant.collectQuickFixableAnnotations(), there is a check to see if the Position for the offset is within the range -- its a call to JavaCorrectionAssistant.isInside(). isInside has the following body: 	private static boolean isInside(int offset, int start, int end) { 		return offset >= start && offset < end; 	} BUT, because the start and end are set to be the same, its NEVER inside. The net effect: any markers with a position set via LINE_NUMBER will not get a quick fix.
