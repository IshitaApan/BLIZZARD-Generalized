wrong proposals for linked folder in New Java Project>Link Additional Resource

3.1RC1 test pass - create new java project - Java Settings wizard page - choose to link in an additional source folder - enter the path to the linked folder, for example /home/user/tmp/linked > the folder name is guessed based on the path name > expected: the last segment is chosen as proposal < actual: the entire path is chosen as the name proposal < the OK button is disabled as '/' is an illegal name character Could it be that the name guessing is windows-path-separator based?
