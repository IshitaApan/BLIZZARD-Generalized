[api][key binding] The "Line Down" key behaves like the down arrow key in Content Assist when editing Java, but not in any other editor

Build ID: I20080609-1311 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Open a C++ or Ruby source file to edit. 2. Make the Content Assist window appear (using the key shortcut or menu) 3. Press the "Line Down" key (in Emacs scheme this is Control-N) More information: When using a key different from the down arrow key to do the "Line Down" command (for example when using the built-in Emacs scheme) the Content Assist window behaves as expected in Java Editor (pressing the Line Down key selects the next entry in the list), but not in any other editor (in C++ for example the selected entry remains the same, but the cursor moves to the next line). Behaviour from the Java Editor is much more usable, so I think it should be the same in all editors. Quick Access could behave the same.
