Feature: Have comment/uncomment actions in context menu [code manipulation] [editor]

Build F2. The source Comment action is no longer available from the right-click context menu. It is available from the Source pull-down menu, as well as the keyboard shortcut, but I think it is much more efficient and usable to have it in the context menu as in previous builds. The reasoning being that generally when you are commenting out text, you are selecting a block of text with the mouse. It is then logical to bring up the context menu to comment/uncomment the text. It is less efficient to have to go under the Source menu, or to have to switch your hand to the keyboard to enter in the shortcut (as typing "<ctrl>-/" with only your left hand is fairly difficult, you must move your mousing hand to the keyboard). Just a suggestion, as I think the comment/uncomment are some of the most frequently-used actions, so it may be justifiable to have them in the context menu.
