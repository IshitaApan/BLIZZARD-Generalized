[preferences] Incorrect padding for Show Whitespace characters preference

Build Identifier: 20110615-0604 The Show whitespace characters preference in the text editors preference page looks misaligned under GTK3. I think this is because setText wasn't called on the check box. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Running GTK3 2. Open the Text Editors preference page 3. observe that the Show Whitespace preference is indented slightly more than other items 4. Clicking on the checkbox also shows a little rectangle next to the check box where the text would normally go.
