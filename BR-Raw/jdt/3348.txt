Here is the scenario. I start with: --protected void finalize() throws Throwable { ----FinalizeAddin(); --} Now I put the cursor right after the opening brace {, hit enter and start typing "//test" followd by a CTRL-S to save the file. I get: --protected void finalize() throws Throwable { --#//test ----FinalizeAddin(); --} The CodeFormatter has no checkmarks except for 'Insert a newline inside an empty block' shouldn't matter. The amount of spaces representing a tab is set to 2 and 'maximum line length' is 80. Since 'Indentation is represented by tab' is unchecked I would expect to see: --protected void finalize() throws Throwable { ----//test ----FinalizeAddin(); --} NOTES:
