[refactoring] Use supertype where possible puts type parameter in import

In RC2. Project attached. I'm having problems minimizing this report--it seems to be dependent on a number of factors. Import the attached project, and try to Use Supertype where Possible on TransactionList, converting it to ArrayList<E>. The only change made is to AccountantTests, where the following line gets added to the imports: import ArrayList<Transaction>.DateComparison;
