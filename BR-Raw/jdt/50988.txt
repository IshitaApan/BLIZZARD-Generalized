3.0M6 - Refactor rename for class members ignore non java files, and java files which are not in the same source folder.

Hi, we have encountered some severe bug in the refactor/rename feature of the JDT in the 30M6 that we have been using intensively since its realease. We have been able to create a simple project where the issues can be reproduced in our environment on two different installation sof 30M6 ()one in WXP, the other in W2K). The setup : a new project with two source trees, tow java suorce, and one xml file with a references to the fully qualified names of instances in the smoe elements. 1st bug : We try refactor/rename on the src/org/test/Reference.java the m_foo member of the tst/org/test/Test.java. The preview, and the refactor will happen in Test.java but WILL NOT UPDATE the m_foo reference in Reference.java. 2nd bug : We try to rename Test.java. Despite we asked for a lookup for fully qualified names everywhere, no proposition to update the xml file is made. 3rd bug : Similar to bug1. We try refactor/rename on the src/org/test/Test.java the m_foo member. The preview, and the refactor will happen only in Test.java but WILL NOT UPDATE the m_foo reference in Reference.java. The attached sample project contanis all the code. We have also tried to do the same things on a brand new Workspace. The bugs behaves exactly the same. We use the 3.0M6 millestone, vanilla. Cheers.
