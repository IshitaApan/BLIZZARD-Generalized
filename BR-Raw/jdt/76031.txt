[search] Unexpected behavior while refactoring member class

Using I200410050800. I have following class in my project: C.java: class C { 	void method() {} 	void foo() { 		method(); 	} } class CC extends C { 	void call() { 		method(); 		new CC().method(); 	} 	void method() {} } I copy it with new name D. I got following class: D.java class D { 	void method() {} 	void foo() { 		method(); 	} } class CC extends D { 	void call() { 		method(); 		new CC().method(); 	} 	void method() {} } => OK I search for reference to D.CC and find only one in call() method of D.CC: => OK Now I want to rename D.CC to D.DD. So, I select CC in D.java, launch refactoring, enter new name DD, look at preview and get 2 changes: D.java: "class CC extends D {" becomes "class DD extends D" => OK C.java: "new CC().method();" becomes "new DD().method()" => KO The second change should be made in D.java not in C.java! Also happen with 3.1 M2.
