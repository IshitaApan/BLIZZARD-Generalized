[templates] Hard to extend Templates View - no access to template store and current selection

User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; pl) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10 Build Identifier: Long story is described on forum: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=158606&start=0&S=6fcd13192a08a6cdee56b93c3fe7b9c4 To summarize: Templates View uses AbstractTemplatesPage which defines two methods: getTemplateStore() and getSelectedTemplates(). They are protected and private respectively which make this view hard to extend. It would be nice to have access from third party plugins to template store which drives particular templates page and to currently selected items in the view. Proposed solution is to add new public method which would act as an alias to protected method getTemplateStore() and to change visibility of getSelectedTemplates to public. This should not break existing code in any way. Reproducible: Always
