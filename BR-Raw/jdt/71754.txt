Ctrl-1 on "extends SomeInterface" does not suggest changing to "implements SomeInterface" [quick fix]

I created a local class, where I used "extends PropertyChangeListener" which is an interface, so the proper syntax is "implements PropertyChangeListener". The compiler catches that PropertyChangeListener is not a class, but Ctrl-1 only suggsts "Rename in file".
