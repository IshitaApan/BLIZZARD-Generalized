JUnit View wasting a lot of screen space [JUnit]

The present visual design of JUnit View UI is vertical-oriented. Usually test names in hierarchy and class names in a failure trace are long and user have to make JUnit UI wider, which affets the rest of workplace UI. From other hand, the most of output went to the console, which is horisontal oriented, and task view area with all of the errors fit to the same place. So, it will be much better to review the present JUnit view and adjust it to fit better in the same spot as console and task view. It will be also good to reduce the size of the area with progress bar and execution statistics (maybe to alligh those into one horizontal row). As an example of the possible design you may look at the screenshot of IDEA JUnit UI at http://joe.truemesh.com/screenshots/idea-junit1.gif
