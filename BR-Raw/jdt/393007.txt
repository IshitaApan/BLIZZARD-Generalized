AbstractInfoView#selectionChanged(..) calls codeResolve in the UI thread if linking is disabled

AbstractInfoView#selectionChanged(..) calls codeResolve in the UI thread if linking is disabled. findSelectedJavaElement(..) is a potentially long-running operation, that's why it's normally called in a background thread. It should also be done in the bg if linking is disabled.
