[templates][content assist] Template completion proposal in javadoc inserts a '<' and duplicates last character

I20051025-0800 + ZRH plugins from 20051028_1210 - Select a word in a javadoc comment - press Ctrl+Space => a '<' is inserted (common prefix?) - select the <code></code> proposal => the template is correctly applied, but the last character of the original selection is (wrongly) added to the end of the inserted proposal
