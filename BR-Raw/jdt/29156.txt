Highlight all occurances of local Java variable

Sorry if this is a duplicate of the one I wrote this morning as I did not get any confirmation. My browser didn't show the confirmation either. Earlier I had requested this feature and I was told that API did not support this kind of search. I recently discovered CTL-1 mechanism and found that it allowed me to rename local variables. I see an opportunity here. If CTL-1 can rename all occurances of a local variable, data member etc, it should also be able to provide an option "highlight all occurances" in the same drop down box. It is a natural place as before I rename I should be able to view all occurance that I am renaming. I hope this makes sense and will fulfill a long time request to bring about ease of development and maintanance of code.
