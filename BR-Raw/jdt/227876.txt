[move method] does not qualify field access

Build ID: I20080409-1425 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Make the following two classes: public class SourceClass { 	DestinationClass destination = new DestinationClass(); 	public void methodToMoveToDestination(String value) { 		this.destination.value = value; 	}	 } public class DestinationClass { 	public String value; } 2. Do a Move Method on SourceClass.methodToMoveToDestination(...) to DestinationClass, and select "Keep original method as delegate to moved method." 3. After refactoring, note that SourceClass is passed as a reference (via this) to the moved method in the DestinationClass. However, it is not needed as a parameter because it is NEVER used in the moved method. This is quite annoying since it requires a Change Method Signature to be done just after the Move Method to get rid of the unnecessary parameter (SourceClass).
