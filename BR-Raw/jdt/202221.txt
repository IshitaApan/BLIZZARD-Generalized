[content assist][5.0] when selected method from favorites is a member of a type with a type variable an invalid static import is added

Build ID: I20070621-1340 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Favorites > New Member ... 2. Enter the member "org.hamcrest.core.IsEqual.equalTo" 3. Create a Java Project with the library - http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hamcrest/hamcrest-all/1.1/hamcrest-all-1.1.jar. 4. Create a Java Class with a main method 5. In the main method type 'equalTo' and then Control-Space to invoke content assist 6. Select the 'equalTo(T operand) Matcher<T> - IsEqual 7. This will add the an import that's invalid, which looks like this - 'import static org.hamcrest.core.IsEqual<T>.equalTo;'. You can't have type variables in import statements. More information: The potential offending code seems to be in the class 'org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.java.ImportCompletionProposal' in the 'computeReplacementString()' method. Here it checks the type of proposal, which in this case is 'CompletionProposal.METHOD_IMPORT' and then gets the qualifiedType from the CompilationProposal.getDeclaredSignature(). It then proceeds to create an ImportRewrite object and adds a static import with the type from the declaredSignature, which contains the type variable. The interesting this is that the CompletionProposal field already has the correct replacement via 'fProposal.getCompletion()', but it includes the entire static import statement, so that can be used with the ImportRewrite, which just seems to accept package names.
