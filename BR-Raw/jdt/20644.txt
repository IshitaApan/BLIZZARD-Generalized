[hovering] Javadoc hover cannot handle link tag

I20020618 In a java file editor type: File.getP and invoke code assist. Scroll down to getPath and wait for hover help. The help claims that "The resulting string uses the { character..." Clearly the { character is not used to separate path components. If you check the Java Doc at http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/index.html You find that { is actually a link "default nae-separator character". So I suspect the problem is whatever we use to massage JavaDoc into hover help content does not handle links properly.
