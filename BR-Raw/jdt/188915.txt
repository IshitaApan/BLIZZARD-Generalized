[spell checking] Java Editor barely usable with spell check on and no dictionary

Version: 3.3.0 Build id: I20070524-0010 J2RE 5.0 IBM J9 2.3 Windows XP x86-32 build j9vmwi3223-20070201 see bugs 188914 and 184381 scenario: - open a brand new workspace - go to Preferences --> General --> Editors --> Text Editors --> Spelling - click the Restore Defaults button - note, dictionary is defaulted to "none" - plugin import (with source) jdt.core - Type Hierarchy: open type JavaCore - open editor for JavaCore - try to scroll in this file - place the cursor somewhere, and try to type something --> response time are not acceptable - the Toolkit sounds like hanging permanently (I'll attach a JVM dump) - close the editor - go to the spelling prefs again and choose the En_Us dictionary - re-open the Java Editor --> response time are OK now. We should improve the spell checking performance, in case we spell check with no dictionary (bug 188914) or in case we spell check files that may flag a lot of warnings (spell check JavaCore with a French dictionary, for example)
