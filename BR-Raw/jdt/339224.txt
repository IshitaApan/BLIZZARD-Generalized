[content assist] ',' does not jump to the next argument if linked position has no proposal

I20110307-2110, follow-up to bug 339221 and bug 337156 void bar(int a, int b) { } void foo() { bar } - have 'Fill method arguments' preference enabled and 'Insert best guessed arguments' selected - use content assist to complete bar => gives "bar(0, 0)" with 2 linked positions but no proposals - type ',' => expected: should jump to second linked position => was: inserts ',' The problem is that ParameterGuesser#parameterProposals(*) only adds ',' as trigger character when there are actual proposals. We need a new mechanism to configure jumping to the next position when no proposals list is up. See caller hierarchy of LinkedModeUI#next(). I guess the best solution is to add a "char[] fTriggerChars" to LinkedModeUI and let clients set trigger chars that are handled in LinkedModeUI.KeyListener#verifyKey(*) by invoking next() if the char is a trigger char.
