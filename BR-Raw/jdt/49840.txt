refactoring "Convert local variable to field" is buggy for arrays [refactoring]

When refactoring the code below to "Convert local variable to field", the type of the variable is not preserved. The type of the field is int, NOT array of int as expected. <my code> void someMethod(){ int someArray[]; } </my code>
