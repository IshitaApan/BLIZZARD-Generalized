[clean up] add 'remove this qualifier' clean up

There is 'add this qualifier' clean up, but there are no 'remove this qualifier'. But what if I have CU with such code style and don't like it? About this code: private int i; void foo(int i) {this.i= i;} May be just check that there are no SingleVariableDeclaration with same identifier in parent method(s)? Plus such code is also possible: public class Test { 	private int field; 	private class Inner { 		private int field; 		public void foo(int i) { 			Test.this.field = i; 		} 	} } So, probably we should also check that there are no field hiding in parent classes.
