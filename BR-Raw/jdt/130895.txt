Closed Projects Filter in Package Explorer no longer removes expansion symbol from empty working sets

This is more of an annoyance than anything. I'm running M5 and the first thing I noticed was that the Closed Projects filter no longer removes the expansion symbol from my working sets when all the projects in that working set are closed. I use the Show->Working Sets option of Package Explorer and in previous version (M4 for example) when you filtered out the closed projects if all the projects in a working set were closed that node in the tree would loose the expansion (plus) symbol. This was really handy. Now I have to click on the expansion symbol for each working set to see if all the projects are closed. I'm not entirely sure what caused this issue, it may be a change to the tree view widget but the Closed Projects filter is now useless to me.
