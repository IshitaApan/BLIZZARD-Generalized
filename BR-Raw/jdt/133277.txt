[actions] Allow Sort Members to be performed on package and project levels

After talking to Martin A at EclipseCon, I suggested that it would be good if Sort Members could be made into an action that could be applied to projects as well as packages, like format and organise imports do. This would then enable such an action to be hooked into the Code Cleanup wizard. I'd love to help out fixing this bug. I've dug around into the code before since I had to apply my own operation to recursively process Java files, and I think that this functionality could be extracted into a superclass that could be made publically available for any others wanting to apply a recursive behaviour to Java projects.
