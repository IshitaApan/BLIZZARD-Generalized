[navigation] Quick outline auto scrolling does not work in cocoa

Created attachment 125548 patch for problem This bug is spin off of bug#262978. 1. open a java file somewhat big (many methods) 2. open the quick outline (command + o) 3. if necessary scroll the tree down vertically, the bug doens't happen if down scroll the tree down 4. move the mouse over tree items -> the selection jumps up and down like crazy There are two bugs in the code that does auto scrolling in AbstractInformationControl (and BreadcrumbItemDropDown). One is Mac/cocoa specific and the other happens on all platforms. The latter happens when there is a horizontal scroll bar in the pop up tree. The code uses tree.getBounds() instead of tree.getClientArea() which makes scrolling down not work. The cocoa specific problem happens because of a difference in SWT, which is not strictly wrong. The coordinate system in scrolled composite depends on the scroll position. So the client area origin is not always (0,0). The attached patch solves both problem. Note that the patch will still work if SWT fixes the differences between the platforms.
