[ltk][scripting] inappropriate internal error when apply script fails [refactoring]

Build: 3.2 RC2 1) Checked out org.eclipse.equinox.common from repository 2) Applied two refactorings (rename method and add parameter, script attached). 3) Exported the plugin as a JAR file, including the refactoring script. 4) Unzipped resulting JAR file to get the script file on disk 5) Deleted project from workspace 6) Checked out the following projects from HEAD: org.eclipse.equinox.common org.eclipse.core.jobs org.eclipse.core.filesystem org.eclipse.core.resources org.eclipse.core.runtime 7) Refactor > Apply Script. 8) Selected the script generated by the export in step 3) -> two "Internal Errors" occur and the script cannot be applied. I will attach the log.
