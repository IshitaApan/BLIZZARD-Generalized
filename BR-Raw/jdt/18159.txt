JUnit and Java App shortcuts overwrite each other

The two shortcuts use the same naming convention for creating configs. If I select VectorTest to run as a Java App, a config is created. If I then run as "Junit" a new config is created with the same name (VectorTest [Junit]), which overwrites/deletes the first one.
