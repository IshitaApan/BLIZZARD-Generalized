3.2 M6 - start Eclipse with fresh workspace - create new Java project "test1" (using separate source and output folders) - create new class "Class1" in package "package1" - create new class "Class2" in package "package1.sub1" - in the Package Explorer toolbar menu select "Package Presentation -> Hierarchical" - in the Package Explorer toolbar menu select "Top Level Elements -> Working Sets" -> the "Select Working Sets" dialog shows up - click "New..." - enter name "My Set" - expand project "test1" and folder "src" - check "package1" and some libs (eg. "...\rt.jar") - click "Finish" - move "My Set" before "Other Projects" (leave both checked) - click "OK" - in the Package Explorer expand "My Set -> package1 -> sub1" (do not expand "Other Projects") - right click on "My Set -> package1 -> sub1" and select "Refactor -> Rename" - enter new name "package1.sub2" - click "OK" => package is renamed successfully => Package Explorer shows a stale element "My Set -> package1 -> package1.sub1" => Package Explorer does not show element "My Set -> package1 -> sub2" => Package Explorer selects element sub2 in "Other Projects -> src -> package1 -> sub2"
