Refactor -> Rename now has confusing/problematic workflow

3.3 M6 The Refactor->Rename based on a text selection in a java editor now has a very strange workflow. Issue 1: It results in a mini yellow in place chooser appearing over the text in question. I don't think I've seen this elsewhere in our UI. A problem is that its a strange UI control to result because instead of it appearing where your mouse was on menu select, its where the source text is. This makes for an odd workflow. Issue 2: Its possible that a selection results in a dialog. This is another odd workflow that we don't have elsewhere as I recall. Issue 3: It has number of options, each one with a quick key suggestion (e.g. "Enter", "Cntrl-Enter". When I hit these keys nothing happens (perhaps this is a different bug, I recall there's one being looked at where the keys go to the wrong shell). Issue 4: I have to carefully select the right hyperlink from the list, this takes a lot of precision which is odd considering the simplicity of the task (I just want the rename dialog). Issue 5: It seems only one option, "Preview" does anything interesting. I don't understand the other options since I never get to fill in what I want it renamed to. Issue 6: Once you select "Rename", even if you do not do select any of the options (e.g. click away), you retain a blue outline around the word in question, such that anytime thereafter that you click in there you get the little yellow rename option dialog. Selection of text doesn't make it go away, only focus loss of the editor. I'm sure this was all done for a reason but I don't understand what it is. The old behaviour of just getting the rename dialog seemed perfectly good, and this new way isn't presenting any advantages to me, only problems.
