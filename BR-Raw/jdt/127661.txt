Refactoring: status not updated upon changes in Introduce Indirection dialog

I20060214-0010 Status not updated upon changes in Introduce Indirection dialog when using the 'Browse...' button or selecting a class from the drop down. Test Case: 1. add CU Test.java with following source: public class Test { 	int foo() { 		return 2; 	} 	int useFoo() { 		return foo(); 	} } class P {} 2. select foo() in useFoo() 3. Refactor > Introduce Indirection ==> warning about duplicate foo() 4. use Browse... and select 'P' ==> warning stays. Same if another class is selected from the drop down.
