[build path] New Java Project Wizard should allow Execution Environment as JRE

I20060330-2000 The New Java Project Wizard should allow choosing an Execution Environment as JRE. Currently, the page only shows the workbench JRE and Alternate JREs -- EEs have to be configured on the Java Build Path properties page or via context menu in the Package Explorer.
