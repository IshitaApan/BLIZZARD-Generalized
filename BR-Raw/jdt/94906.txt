Selecting an element in Package Explorer calls 3 times EditorUtility.revealInEditor

I20050509-2010 I have open on single-click enabled. When linking is disabled EditorUtility.revealInEditor is triggered only once but as soon as linking is enabled it gets sent three times when an element is selected in Package Explorer (assuming the CU is already open). Opening a CU results in revealing two times. If open on double-click is checked and linking enabled it reveals twice upon element selection (assuming the CU is already open).
