[misc] Outline of binary type does not show children in source order

I20060131-1200 The Outline of a binary type with source attachment always shows the type's children in fields/methods/types order. I would expect them to be in source declaration order if the outline is not in alphabetic mode. Unfortunately, IType#getChildren() makes no guarantees about the order. To fix this problem, either the outline would have to sort the children manually by source position, or jdt.core would have to provide them in source order.
