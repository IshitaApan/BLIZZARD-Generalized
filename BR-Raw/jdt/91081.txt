[quick fix] Quick complete should introspect method change when return val from method

If a known return is had from a method, and the method does not return that type, or any type (ie returns void), there should be a quick fix to a) change method return type 2) change implementing method return type to that of returning method (or void if no return). A bit complex, here's a video: http://benow.ca/misc/return_quick_fix.swf Using: eclipse-SDK-I20050401-1645-linux-gtk Thanks!
