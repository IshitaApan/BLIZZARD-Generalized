'close project' not available in the package view (1GEHFLT)

AK (5/29/01 12:05:55 PM) 	should the 'close project' action be available also in the package view? NOTES: EG (5/29/01 5:31:26 PM) 	not for June EG (7/12/01 2:23:28 PM) 	this requires JavaModel support so that closed projects show up in the UI. 	Otherwise closing a project makes it disappear.
