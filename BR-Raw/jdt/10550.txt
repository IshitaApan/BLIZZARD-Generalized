Hilight cursor row (accessibility for the visually impaired)

I am legally blind, with good central vision but very little peripheral vision. This makes it extremely difficult to follow and locate the cursor when it moves outside of my direct control. This is especially true since I can't make use of highlighting, as I need a high constrast (i.e. dark) background (see, for example, bug 10050). I would like a way for the editor to do one of the following (in order of preference, lowest to highest): 1) provide line numbers, so I can use the cursor position information in the status bar to guide me to the right line 2) provide some visual indication in the left vertical bar (where compile error icons and such appear) of the current line 3) provide the ability to optionally highlight the entire line on which the cursor is currently placed (with the ability to select the highlight and text colors)
