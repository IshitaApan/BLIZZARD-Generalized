[typing][content assist] Extra bracket gets generated as shown: System.out.println() )

In the Java IDE, after typing out System.out.println( and pressing SPACEBAR, on a fresh line, generates System.out.println() ) This happens only when the content-assist window pops up. On trying to edit the line again, the problem does not show up, as long as the content-assist window is not up again.
