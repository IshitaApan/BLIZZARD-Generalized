Created attachment 85562 Zip containing 2 projects I20071218-0800 (also observed with 3.3.1.1) 1. Start on a new workspace 2. Import the 2 projects in the attached zip 3. Expand P2/Referenced Libraries/bin/p/X.class The Package Explorer should show X with one field called 'field1' 4. Open P1/src/p.X.java 5. Rename field1 to field 2 in the Java editor 6. Save (this should build X.java) Observe: The Package Explorer still shows field1 Note the delta correctly reports that the content of X.class has changed: Java Model[*]: {CHILDREN} P2[*]: {CHILDREN} /P1/bin[*]: {CHILDREN} p[*]: {CHILDREN} X.class[*]: {CONTENT}
