Breakpoint no hit if on variable declaration with no initialization

Build 20011219 It seems that a breakpoint will not be considered if located on a variable declaration with no initialization (in my case, it was the first statement of the method): org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.codegen.CodeStream public void generateSyntheticArgumentValues(BlockScope currentScope, ReferenceBinding targetType, Expression enclosingInstance, AstNode invocationSite) { 	// perform some emulation work in case there is some and we are inside a local type only *	ReferenceBinding[] syntheticArgumentTypes;
