[build path] Build Path action "no actions available" should be disabled

3.2 M5 testing - have a java project with a Jar file on the build path - expand the jar file in the pkg explorer - in context menu on a package, open the 'Build Path...' sub menu - there is an entry "no actions available" > expected: it is disabled < actual: it is enabled
