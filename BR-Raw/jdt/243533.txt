[typing] Tab is not indenting line in Java editor

1. In Window>Preferences>Java>Editor>Typing uncheck "Tab key adjusts the indentation of the current line". 2. Go to the "formatter preference page" (the easiest to follow the link). Create custom style setting "Tab policy" to "Spaces only" ("Mixed" also got the problem). Apply the style. 3. Edit Java file. Enabling "Show whitespace characters" to see all spaces/tabs might be beneficial. Enter the example in the file. Make sure the semicolon at the 3-rd line is at the first position: void main() { for(;;) ; } Place the cursor before that single semicolon at the 3-rd line. 4. Press Tab key 3 times. The cursor jumps 8 characters (indenting after "for") the first time and not moving anymore. The correct behavior would be to advance adding 4 more spaces (equal indentation size) each time - since "Tab key adjusts the indentation of the current line" is unchecked.
