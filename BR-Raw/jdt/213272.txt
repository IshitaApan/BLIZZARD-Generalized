JUnit result comparison does not use compare text font

Created attachment 85442 Unit test to trigger text comparison Build ID: M20071023-1652 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Run the attached unit test 2. Double-click on the failure trace in the JUnit view to open the compare window 3. Look how difficult it is to spot the white space differences More information: I would have expected that the compare window uses the default compare text font as specified in the preferences, but that does not seem to be the case. As I often need to verify white space diffs, using a non-monospaced font severely defeats the usefulness of the compare window for me. I'm using Eclipse 3.3.1.1 on Ubuntu 7.10-64, Java 6.0_03. Please let me know if you need any further information. Thank you.
