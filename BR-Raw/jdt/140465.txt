[JUnit] Test failure: sometimes can't run JUnit tests from runtime workbench

I20060505-1306 Test failures in this build: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/I20060505-1306/testresults/html/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests_win32.win32.x86.html The problem is that the runtime tries to launch a third VM but can't resolve the correct junit.runtime. Works fine if the host workbench contains org.eclipse.junit.runtime from CVS, but fails if it is not imported. The bug is in ClasspatchLocalizer#localURL(..): it used to throw an IOException in that case (due to an invalid path), which made the fallback in entryString(..) take over and resolve the situation. Now, ClasspatchLocalizer#localURL(..) throws a NullPointerException.
