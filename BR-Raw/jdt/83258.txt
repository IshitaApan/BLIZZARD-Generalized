[jar exporter] Deploy java application as executable jar

Hello, the following enhancement could be included into the JDT (JAR-Export-Wizard): Create an executable JAR file (with "java -jar xxx.jar") from a java project including all referenced libraries and sub-projects. This can be achieved by unzipping all referenced JARs and zipping all classes together with the project output into a new jar. Another solution could be to write a specialised Class-Loader which handles JAR-Files inside a JAR. I have written a Plug-In called Fat-Jar which implements this feature http://fjep.sourceforge.net Now I would like to help integrate it into the Eclipse platform and asked how to get involved. The answer was to start an enhancement request in bugzilla. So this first step is done.... ;) Best regards, Ferenc Hechler
