Move Destination shows empty folders as packages (1G46Z2X)

The move destination shows empty folders as packages whereas the packages viewer doesn't. 	The UI should be consistent in this matter. 	Steps to reproduce: 	1.) create a new source folder 	2.) create a package a.b.c.d in the source folder 	3.) Select move from context menu. 		 The move destination dialog shows the following packages 			a 			a.b 			a.b.c 			a.b.c.d NOTES: EG (11/13/00 2:45:49 PM) 	no, you can move a package into an empty package. 	Veto if you disagree. EG (12/5/2000 5:04:11 PM)	fixed 	the empty folder are now shown as folders and not packages MA (14.12.00 15:40:51) 	the destination dialog does not offer the project itself as a destination for the resource. 	you can however select the default package as destination, which results in having a file 	in the project 	i think the whole thing is still a bit too confusing. moved to inbox
