[misc] Softening visibility of parts of JavaOutlinePage

We would like to reuse internal parts of JavaOutlinePage (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=151280 for a short "why"). Would it be possible to get protected read access to JavaOutlinePage's fOutlineViewer and fTopLevelTypeOnly members? Additionally, we would like to have (some of) its inner classes accessible, namely ChildrenProvider, ElementChangedListener and JavaOutlineViewer. If those could be made public we could avoid a lot of Copy&Paste code.
