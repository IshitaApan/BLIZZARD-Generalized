Generate getter and setter: set field name as default return value

Unfortunately, the new Eclipse version does not create a get/set method in the form of 	/** 	 * Description. 	 * 	 * @return string 	 */ 	public String getName() { 		return name; 	} anymore but it leaves out the value of the @return param: 	/** 	 * Description. 	 * 	 * @return 	 */ 	public String getName() { 		return name; 	} But this has the bad side effect that generating javadoc generates warnings for each method that was automatically generated via "Generate getter and setter" function of eclipse. To get a clean javadoc creation back again, you have to fill in the @return value by hand which makes all the nice automatic stuff rather useless. i suggest to set the field name as the default return value: 	/** 	 * Description. 	 * 	 * @return name 	 */ 	public String getName() { 		return name; 	} which should be quite easy to implement as each get/set method is created based on this field name!
