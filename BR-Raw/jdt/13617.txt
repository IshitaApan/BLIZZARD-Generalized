[navigation] Next problem doesn't always update status line

Build 20020409 - new Java class Test - insert method: public void run() { } - replace void with voyd by replacing i with y (cursor should be positions after y) - save (with autobuild on) - it finds the problem and displays it in the ruler, shows squiggles, and adds it to the task list - however, it is not shown in the status line - hit Ctrl+E - it has no effect - move the cursor outside the squiggle - hit Ctrl+E again - now it works and the status line updates - place the cursor above this line - hit Ctrl+E - it repositions on the error, but the status line is blank The status line should always show the error when Next/Prev Problem is used. Also, it would be good if it showed the error whenever the cursor entered an error range.
