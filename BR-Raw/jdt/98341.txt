Override/Implement Methods shows nonvisible methods.

The Override/Implement Methods refactoring dialog shows all methods with package-private access, even if they are in other packages. Example: package foo; public class Foo { 	void method() {} } package bar; public class Bar extends foo.Foo { 	 } Activating the Override/Implement Methods on Bar shows Foo.method.
