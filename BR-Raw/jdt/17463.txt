Replace with previous element from local history should ignore unparseable versions

Build F1 If the previous version of a file can't be parsed, then 'Replace with previous element from local history' replaces the element with the entire contents of the previous edition. I believe that this behaviour is incorrect. It should either continue searching in older versions until it finds a version with the element, or do nothing. Create the following Java file and save it: public class Hello { 	public Hello() { 		super(); 		System.out.println("Hello world"); 	} } Replace the contents with the following and save: dfjlkfdjklnbv dfbdfjhkfldbf f dbfdsjlgvbsdb fdsgkldfsg Replace the contents with the following and save: public class Hello { 	public Hello() { 		super(); 		System.out.println("Hello world"); 	} } Now select the constructor in the Outline view. Choose 'Replace with previous element from local history'. The resulting file is: public class Hello { 	dfjlkfdjklnbv 	dfbdfjhkfldbf 	f 	dbfdsjlgvbsdb 	fdsgkldfsg }
