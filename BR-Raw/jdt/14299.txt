Package filter [browsing]

Hello, I would suggest the following useful feature ; could it be possible to add a filter in the package view of the java browsing perspective, and elsewhere in order to aneble the user to filter the "package", "protected", "private", "public" classes of a package or a group of packages. Actually we often need to have in a glance all public classes of a package or a group of packages.... It corresponds to the interface of a an application towards the external world. Nobody in other tools implements this feature , except maybe in modeling tools like STOOD(a implementation tool of the HOOD method or the UML tools). Best regards Xavier
