[reconciling] Need a save synchronization method to ensure transactional updating of problem requestor

I20031113 Each working copy has a problem requestor for its lifetime. The problem requestor needs to be updated transactionally, i.e. no interleaving start/end call pairs. In order to ensure that, IWorkingCopy.reconcile should only be called when being in a monitor locking the working copy. This scheme is "per convention" and not satisfied by the Java core itself. We need a better scheme to also avoid the reconciler to become active during long running operations involving files open in editors such as refactorings across many files. A workspace operation using the working copy as scheduling rule seems appropriate. Need to check how to deal with working copies without an underlying resource. Need to check for the most appropriate location, i.e. caller or callee.
