DeferredMethodWrapper needs to update imports

We are going to move IElementCollector to org.eclipse.ui.progress in M9 so please update your imports accordingly in DeferredMethodWrapper . The org.eclipse.ui.progress.IElementCollector currently extends org.eclipse.jface.progress.IElementCollector but this dependency will be severed in M9 and the jface version will be deleted.
