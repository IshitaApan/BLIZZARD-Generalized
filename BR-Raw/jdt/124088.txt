Generate equals() should check wether cast is possible

Just checked out the new Source > Generate equals and hashcode feature. I wonder why in the method, the classes of the two Objects are not compared. I can see a check for super.equals and a cast afterwards. I had expected something like if (!getClass().equals(obj.getClass()) return false; Ben
