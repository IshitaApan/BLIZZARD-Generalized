[assist] Inconsistent completions for member types

Build 3.4M4 The following 2 scenarii do not trigger similar proposals: 1. Map is not imported public class X { 	void foo() { 		Map.<CODEASSIST HERE> 	} } --> Offers 'Entry' with 'java.util.Map' as qualifier 2. Map is imported import java.util.Map; public class X { 	void foo() { 		Map.<CODEASSIST HERE> 	} } --> Offers 'Map<K,V>.Entry<K,V>' with 'java.util' qualifier I find (2) inconsistent. (1) is more concise, and doesn't provide enclosing type as completion name (only as qualifier, which it really is). Also, in (2) the proposed named suggests arguments for Map, which is irrelevant, since a raw type got entered (completion is behind the dot). Note that it only inserts a raw type in the end.
