[plan item] Place incremental find status into separate status line item

Incremental find uses the workbench window status line. When having a post selection text listener that tries to find and display the error or warning underlying the current selection, the incremental find status and the error message are wipping out each other. Status line contribution item needs no to be editable but should support tooltips. Enable error updating on post selection event in Java editors.
