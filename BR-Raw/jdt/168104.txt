[preferences] Make configurable errors non-fatal preference option more prominent

If I want to mark Unused Imports as errors in my files, I should be able to do so without preventing that CU from being compiled successfully. My desire is to see a Red X in the decorators for Tasks View, Synchronize View, etc., not to prevent the file from compiling. Some teams allow warnings to be present in their files. For example, a reference to a deprecated class cannot be hidden without compiling with Java 5. In this use case, there are more severe levels of hygiene errors that should be displayed as red X's, but should not cause compile problems that prevent running and hot-swapping.
