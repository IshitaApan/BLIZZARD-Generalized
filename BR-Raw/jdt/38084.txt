Refactor/Rename field; inconsistent 'getter' format [refactoring]

When renaming a field, the dialog prompts to rename the getter as appropriate. The dialog says: Rename getter 'String getName()' to 'getNewName' The format of the old and new name are different; the type is missing from the front and there are no parenthesis after the method name. I think it should be: Rename getter 'String getName()' to 'String getNewName()' or even Rename getter 'getName()' to 'getNewName()' since it doesn't really matter what the type of the method is; if it does, there should be a 'change field signature' in the same way as a 'change method signature' to modify it. I suspect that the same is also true for a setter, but I've not seen the renaming in action for that.
