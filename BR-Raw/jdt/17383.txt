create getter/setter - no explicit hint if getter/setter already exist

Create getter/setter seems to know which getter/setters exist already. However, there's no explicit way to show this. I can figure out by selecting the type (only not existing getter/setter are shown). If I select a field, I see all the setter/getter of the type and I loose the information which setter and getter exist already.
