[search] is unkind to its participants

PDE is on its way to becoming a Java-seach-participant to show hits in manifest files. It's all going swimmingly, except that annotations are not being created when the manifest editor opens. The problem seems to be in JavaSearchResult#computeContainedMatches(...). This method returns an empty array if the file being opened is not a Java file. This clearly causes a problem for PDE who is solely interested in manifest files (manifest.mf and plugin.xml). So the editor opens but no pretty yellow arrows or blue markers.
