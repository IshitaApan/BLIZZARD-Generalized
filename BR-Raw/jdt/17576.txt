JavaSearchPage.SearchPatternData must be a static class

F1 it's a non static class now, which leads to leaks: the static variable (!always a leak danger!) in JavaSearchPage contains a list of previous patterns, each holding an instance of JavaSearchPage (exactly because SearchPatternData is not static) static fields of type List + non static nested classes = trouble
