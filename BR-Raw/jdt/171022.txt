[build path] Editing of user library resets export state of this library

Build ID: M20060921-0945 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Create Java project 2.Create user library in this project and add some jars. 3.In "Build path/Configure buid path.../Order and Export" select this user library to export. Press Ok. 4. Edit this user library (add and remove some jars). 5. Check export status of the library on "Build path/Configure buid path.../Order and Export" More information: Behavior is not 100% reproducible and consistent. It occurs most of the time but not always. As well I have seen a situation when export state of the library was Ok (checked), but library was not exported (other projects that hve this one on their build path have not seen jars from the library). Unchecking the library on "Order and Export" page, then "Ok", then checking it back solves the problem.
