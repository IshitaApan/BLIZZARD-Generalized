Hierarchy View takes 8 minutes to start up

In my workspace I have 24 projects. In each case, the java build path contains about 20 or more jar files from a target platform which I am extending with new plugins. I have one java perspective, which contains the following views: packages, navigator, outline. In the shortcut bar, I have the tasks, search, and repository view. There are no editors open. It takes about 20 seconds to start up. If I open the JavaEditor class using Open Type.., a java edior opens on the class and the hierarchy view opens. If I close the editor, shutdown, and restart, it takes me 8 minutes to restart. If I close the hierarchy view, shutdown, and restart, it takes about 20 seconds to start up. I am now afraid to shutdown eclipse with the hierarchy view open. Please help me.
