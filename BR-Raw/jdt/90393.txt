3.1 M6: File Global Search and Replace cannot write file

3.1 M6: File Global Search and Replace cannot write file. I try to replace a word that occurs in multiple files in a project. I do this using the File Search and Replace dialog. Eclipse correctly searches and indicates that the files need to be opened for editing (I am using Perforce source code control). Then when I try to do "Replace all", the problem occurs intermittently. Sometimes the replace works fine. More often than not, it dies claiming that it cannot write the file that it had just opened for editing! I have observed this behavior only since M5 and M6.
