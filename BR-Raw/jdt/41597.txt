move instance method: fails for "this"-qualified field access [refactoring]

Field accesses of the form this.s are not handled properly. Note that they need different behavior depending on context: - As target of a MethodInvocation: => implicit "this" => remove it. - Otherwise: explicit "this". Example: move A::print() to field s ----------------------------------- package p; public class A { 	Second s; 	Second s2; 	public void print() { 		int s= 17; 		this.s.foo(s2); 		this.s2.foo(this.s); 	} } package p; class Second { 	public void foo(Second s) { 	} }
