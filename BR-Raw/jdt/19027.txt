[javadoc wizard] Ok after validating Javadoc location pref page opens browser [javadoc]

Build F2 1. Open properties of a JAR or Java project 2. Select "Javadoc Location" 3. Enter a valid location e.g: http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/teaching/java/jdk1.3/docs/api/ 4. Press "Validate" 5. Since I read "Locaton is valid. ..." I pressed OK ==> Browser opens - this is strange even the dialog would tell (if I had read all the text). I think the main action was to validate the location therefore the natural path (i.e. clicking OK) should not open a browser.
