[templates][content assist] Ctrl+Space without any starting letter shows to no templates

I finally realized that the "empty" CTRL+Space does not show any templates. I think it would be much more helpful if the empty statement show all templates. Example: No line in the editor-> CTRL+Space should display all templates. B-> CTRL+Space shows Browser and Button template. I would assume that this change would be relatively easily, please feel free to guide me to the right class so that I can try to fix that.
