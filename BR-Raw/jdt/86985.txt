TTypes environment should throw exception with null as binding key or  type binding

I20050301 The TypeEnvironment that manages TTypes should be more strict with regards to accepting null values. I found two null-checks which whould better just throw a NullPointerException rather than hiding the existence of a bug somewhere. a) TType#initialize(..) should not accept null for the binding and it should also throw an exception when the binding key is null. b) TypeEnvironment#createTypeBindings(..) should not accept a null binding and should also throw an exception when the ASTParser did not call back for a requested binding key. The current behavior caused me a long debugging session just to find out that bug 83500 has not been fixed.
