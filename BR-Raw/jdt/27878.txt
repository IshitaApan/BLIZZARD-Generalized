infinite loop?

build N1206 on Win2K, IBM VM 1.3.1 in the big workspace I started up, opened the java perspective and navigated to org.eclipse.core.resources/src. When I clicked to expand the src folder my CPU went to 100% for alone time (forever?). Using ctrl-break I got the attached core dump which indicates that the RenameSupport.create() method appears to be called infinitely. Note that memory use does not seem to be increasing.
