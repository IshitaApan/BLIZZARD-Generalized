[preferences] Finish adding note to Compiler > Javadoc pref page

I20091013-1302. Initial changes have been made to add a note to the Compiler > Javadoc pref page. This needs to be finished: 1. "Note:" is not bold as elsewhere in the preference. Notes should be added using PreferencePage.createNoteComposite(Font, Composite, String, String) 2. strings are not externalized 3. work in progress comments should be removed
