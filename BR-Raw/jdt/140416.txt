[content assist] restore proposal computers if none present

In order to provide interest-ranked content assit Mylar has its own javaCompletionProposalComputer's, which are configured automatically upon Mylar install via a preference setting wizard: http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/faq.php#content-assist The problem is that when Mylar is uninstalled the workspace is left in the confusing state of having no Java proposal computers enabled and to the user it seems as if content assist has stopped working. Mylar is not the only plug-in that could get JDT UI into this state, so I'm wondering if JDT UI should be defensive against this somehow. E.g., if no java computers other than the 2 provided by JDT UI are present, and both of those are disabled, on startup pop up a dialog asking whether content assist should be re-enabled, and ensure the user can click "don't warn me again" if they really meant to turn those proposal computers off?
