Add Java Exception Breakpoint dialog should use JavaUI#createTypeDialog(..)

HEAD With the fix for bug 170603, the Add Java Exception Breakpoint dialog went away from reusing JavaUI#createTypeDialog(..) and added its own FilteredItemsSelectionDialog. But with bug 172348, the expensive type hierarchy computation on Exception was dropped again for performance reasons. The current situation has at least two disadvantages (and no clear advantage) over reusing JavaUI#createTypeDialog(..): - Add Java Exception Breakpoint suffers from bugs that are fixed in the Open Type dialog (e.g. it does not work with qualified types, does not support working sets) - JDT/UI's support for extended type selection dialogs is not tested any more. I think JDT/Debug should drop the custom AddExceptionDialog and revive org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.breakpoints.AddExceptionDialogExtension.
