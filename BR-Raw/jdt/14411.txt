Build 20020418 If you define the following cu: public class X { public void foo(String) { } public void foo(String, String) { } } and you choose to sort in the Outline, you get the following order: X +- foo(String, String) +- foo(String) I would expect to have: X +- foo(String) +- foo(String, String)
