enclosing_package template variable doesn't seem to work [code manipulation]

I'm trying to use the template variable "enclosing_package" as the value behind a package statement within a template, as follows: package ${enclosing_package}; However, the variable never gets replaced with anything, and I end up having to type out the package name.
