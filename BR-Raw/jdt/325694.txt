[call hierarchy] Delete key should remove element from view instead of deleting it

Call hierarchy could be extended in the way that it's behavior matches the "standart" behavior of the search view. 1) "Delete" action deletes the Java element from the *code*. This is VERY inconvenient. Expected: as in the Search view, the *search result* is removed from view. Additionally, "del" keybinding should be used by the "remove from view" context menu. 2) There is no way to open multiple call hierarchies at same time. Expected: as in the Search view, "Pin this view" button should be available at the view toolbar.
