[assist] erroneous insert after CA on the New Class Wizard

Version: 3.4.0 Build id: I20080324-1300 (sounds like introduced between 331 and 332) 1 - create a Java Project 2 - open the New Class Wizard 3 - click the Add button to add an interface 4 - select Entry from java.util.Map and add it Note: interface java.util.Map.Entry is added 5 - remove the '.E' in the added interface 6 - invoke CA at cursor (|): java.util.Map.E| before 332: java.util.Map.Entry is added after 332 (and this is the bug): java.util.Map.java.util.Map.Entry is added As a variation, also note that if you remove all the text before the interface icon, you'll notice it gets highlighted as proposing some Content Assist. Invoke CA: nothing shows-up --> we should not suggest there might be CA when none will be displayed.
