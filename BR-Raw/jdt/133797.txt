Categories filter group should use LRU

I20060329-0010. Categories filter group should use LRU: currently when I change visibility for a category via 'Visible Categories...' it can happen that afterwards I can't toggle it via menu. The last changed categories should be in the menu. ==> - content of menu should be compiled using LRU - menu entries should then be sorted alphabetically
