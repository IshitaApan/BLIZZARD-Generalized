Refactor / Rename Package doesn't allow rename to same name with different case [refactoring]

When using Refactor/Rename on a package in Ecipse 2.1.0, I try to rename package OtherPackage to "otherpackage" but it will not let me, giving the error message, "A resource exists with a different case". I can get around it by naming the package "otherXXXpackage", and *then* to "otherpackage", but hey.
