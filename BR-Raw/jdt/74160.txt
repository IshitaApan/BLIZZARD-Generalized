QuickFix 'Create Method in other CU' doesn't use compound undo [quick fix]

M200409161125 - Invoke QuickFix 'Create Method in other CU' as e.g. in bug 74158. - Invoke Edit > Undo -> Expected: whole method stub removed -> Was: method stub is removed in small pieces I guess the pieces come from the ASTRewrite, and the fix would be to enclose the rewriting operation in a compound text operation.
