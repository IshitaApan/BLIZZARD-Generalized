Show invisible characters on formatter preview

I20070410-1043 As a 3.3 polish we can add a checkbox to the formatter preview on the formatter preferences modify dialog to enable/disable invisible characters: Preview: |dasdfd | |afadfdsfafdadf | | dsafasddffdsafas | [x] Show invisible characters Unchecked by default. This would especially help to understand the tab policy. I'm showing invisible characters on the clean up modify dialog (bug 173079). It's basically the same code.
