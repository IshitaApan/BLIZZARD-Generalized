[JUnit] can create two launch configurations with the same name

Against N20050525-0010. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a project named "directions", with a package named also named "directions". (I'll attach an example) 2) Select the project name, and Run As > JUnit Test 3) Select the package name, and Run As > JUnit Test Two launches named "directions" are created. Interestingly, if you swap steps 2 and 3, then the launches are given unique names (the project launch is named "directions (1)".
