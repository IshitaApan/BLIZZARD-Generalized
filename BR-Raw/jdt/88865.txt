MoveInstanceMethodTests#testFail7() should work now

Bindings.findType(ITypeBinding, ..) now uses ITypeBinding#getJavaElement(), which also works for local types. MoveInstanceMethodTests#testFail7() used to get a FATAL in checkFinalConditions(..) because the target type was not found. I disabled the test for now. The scenario of testFail7() is currently not reproducable from the UI anyway, since MoveInstanceMethod is disabled for local types. This restriction can now be dropped and the test can be converted into a succeeding test once the UI also allows to move methods to local types.
