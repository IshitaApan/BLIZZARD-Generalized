Smoke 20: Rendering of methods different in Class Hierarchy / Outliner (1FZOKGK)

MA (8/14/00 6:09:15 PM) 	1. open java.lang object form rt.jar with correct source annotation 	2. activate static methods in the class hierrachy viewer 	3. the hierarhcy viewer renders a method <clinit>, which is not shown in the outliner MA (8/14/00 6:09:20 PM) 	I think, static initializers should be rendered which a human readable name, also in source files NOTES: KUM (8/15/00 6:11:17 PM) 	<clinit> are compiler generated initializers. They are different from the initializer code which can be 	placed directly into the source of a class such as 			class X { 				{ 						// initializer per instance 				} 				static { 						// class initializer 				} 			} 	Such initializers show up in the outline and in the method view. <clinit> shouldn't show up in the 	type viewer's method list. EG (8/31/00 8:00:37 PM) 	agreed, synthetic initializers should be hidden MA (11/7/00 6:05:24 PM) 	filtered out in TypeHierarchy > 25 AK (11/16/00 4:30:18 PM) 	not fixed 	initializers show up only in the outliner now 	(so it's changed since KUM wrote the comment above) EG (12/5/00 1:05:46 PM) 	consider once we are on new SEF DM (1/29/01 12:34:40 PM) 	Verified --> not fixed 	The problem is now also in the Ouline view and the problem is even 	worse in my opinion because the default constructor is now rendered as if it 	would be real (i.e. explicitly defined in the class). 	Test Case: java.applet.Applet.class 	==> synthetic members should be shown but recognizable as such. 	MINOR PROBLEM - NOT FOR WEDNESDAY MA (20.08.2001 17:23:13) 	Initializers were not rendered in the type hierarchy. added in 200 	Can't see constructors in outline for class files.
