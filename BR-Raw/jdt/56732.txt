Call Hierarchy doesn't show callees of method from anonymous type

3.0M8: Call Hierarchy doesn't show callees of method from anonymous type. Callees of m() are correctly shown: println(String) and Runnable. However, callees of run() are empty, although run() calls println(String). class A { 	void m() { 		System.out.println("before"); 		Runnable runnable= new Runnable() { 			public void run() { 				System.out.println("run"); 			} 		}; 		runnable.run(); 	} }
