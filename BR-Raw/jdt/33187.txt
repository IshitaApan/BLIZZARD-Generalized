Eclipse stops working at seemingly random times...

Whenever I am using the Linux-GTK version of Eclipse, eventually, eclipse will stop opening files. It will simply never bring up the editor when I double- click on files. I have previously opened them, and I have never had this problem in the Windows version. There does not seem to be any triggering event that I could note. Eventually, it just stopped working. When I close Eclipse, it says an error occured. Check the error log. I wasn't sure where the error log was, but I would be happy to reinstall Eclipse 2.1 and get it to happen again if someone will tell me where to look for this. The problem did has never appeared in the Windows version, or version 2.0 or prior. I only noticed it in Eclipse 2.1 RC1, and the one just prior to it (I cannot remember if this was G6 or G5 or M5, but the stable release just before RC1).
