[templates] Indentation of Javadoc template mangled on insertion

I20110310-1119 I tried to create a Javadoc template with name BETA_JAVA7 and this content (properly formatted, i.e. without Bugzilla's additional line breaks): * This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java * Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes * only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP. * When I try to insert this into the standard Eclipse header comment at the beginning of line * Contributors: , the result is this: * This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java * Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes * only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP. * * Contributors: => first line misses first space => last line has 1 space too much
