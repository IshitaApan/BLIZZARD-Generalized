Finding references to variables does not find all occurances

When searching for variables by using the context menu command "refernces" not all occurances are found. After some investigation as an informed user I could track it down to a simple sample (see below). Find all references to the var "willSearchFingMe". All occurances are found except the one in "getWillSearchFndMe2()". If you remove the brackets around "this.willSearchFindMe" it will be found. ----- package com; public class EclipseSearchTest { 	String willSearchFndMe; 	 	public String getWillSearchFndMe() { 		return willSearchFndMe; 	} 	public String getWillSearchFndMe2() { 		return (this.willSearchFndMe); 	} 	public void setWillSearchFndMe(String willSearchFndMe) { 		this.willSearchFndMe = willSearchFndMe; 	} }
