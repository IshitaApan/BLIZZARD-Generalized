[breadcrumb] looks strange for file inside IFolder

Created attachment 87504 Screenshot HEAD Breadcrumb bar looks strange for .java file inside an IFolder, see screenshot. Expected: - folder should be 'expandable' like other breadcrumbs - folder should be in its own compartment (add vertical line after it)
