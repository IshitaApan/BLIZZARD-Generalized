[content assist] Code complete is vague when multiple Options exist for Enum member type on annotation

Build Identifier: Assuming JPA annotation javax.persistence.OneToMany If defining the cascade member on the annotation and the CascadeType is not already imported I am presented with 3 different CascadeType which provide no detail as to which is which. javax.persistence.CascadeType org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType org.hibernate.metamodel.binding.CascadeType I think the package name should be provided so that you can see which option you want to select and or limit to javax.persistence.CascadeType which is the only acceptable type for member cascade on javax.persistence.OneToMany Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add Annotation 2. Add member 3. See complete options
