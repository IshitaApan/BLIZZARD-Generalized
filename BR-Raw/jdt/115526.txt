[javadoc wizard] Misses some packages loading javadoc.xml

I have this javadoc.xml that defines a javadoc export spanning several Eclipse projects. The problem is that for one of the projects the UI is populated incorrectly, that is, some of the packages are left unselected (and hence not included in the final documentation). The project organization is as follows: BuddyStream Java API (all selected) BuddyStream Server c~.b~.db (should be all selected, but it's empty) c~.b~.db.mysql (should be all selected, but it's empty) c~.b~.logging (should be all selected, but it's empty) c~.b~.plugins (should be all selected, but it's empty) c~.b~.server (all files but one are selected, that's expected) c~.b~.util (all selected) ... a few other projects, some all selected, some partially, all work as expected. The only project that seems to have problems is the one that mixes per package and per file selections. In this case, the only package that is not wholly selected is c~.b~.server, and I believe that causes the problem. All packages up to that one are listed by package in javadoc.xml, but c~.b~.server and c~.b~.util are described file by file. The former appear unselected while the latter appear properly selected. The result is that everytime I want to generate the documentation I have to manually add those packages. The javadoc.xml file will be attached below.
