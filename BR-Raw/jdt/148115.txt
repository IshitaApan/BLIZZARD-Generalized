errors in JDT user and isv doc

I used a software tool to run accessibility checks of the content in the <> Doc and found some problems. I will attach the reports, with a list of the problems sorted by severity (most severe first). Each problem lists the file, line number, severity and error. Please have a look at the reports and act as follows: 1. Fix problems with severity SV(severe violation) and V(violation) first. 2. Investigate whether problems marked with severity PSV(possible severe violation) and PV(possible violation) are truly problems and fix as required. 3. Optionally correct problems marked with severity I(informational); often these are deprecations. Some of the errors in the /reference files of the step1-reports appear to be due to the javadoc generator. Does a separate bug need to be opened if that is the case?
