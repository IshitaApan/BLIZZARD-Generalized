[refactoring] Refactoring participant actions get lost during preview involving back, next

I am not sure whether to reopen Bug 132137 or Bug 139513, but since those are actually feature requests which are now basically solved, I open a new real bug report: I experienced it with the rename refactoring; but if all of PDE's refactoring participants are implemented the same way, they likely all have the same problem: When selecting Back and Next in the refactoring preview, PDE's refactoring participant actions are lost. Setup: You need a project with a manifest file. Create one e.g. using a PDE template: a) File -> New -> Plug-in Project b) Enter some project name, e.g. "myPlugin" c) Next d) Next e) Select e.g. "Plug-in with a view" f) Next g) Finish Now, rename a class which is referenced in the manifest file. For the above setup, it would be class "SampleView": 1) Select in the package explorer src/myplugin/myplugin.views/SampleView.java 2) Open the context menu on that selection: Refactor -> Rename 3) Provide a new name, e.g. "SampleView2" 4) Next -- Leads correctly to preview listing among others "Rename classes referenced in plug-in manifest files" 5) Back 6) Next -- Leads wrongly to preview listing without "Rename classes referenced in plug-in manifest files" 7) Finish -- Leads wrongly to no rename in plugin.xml (Without steps 5) and 6), everything is fine.)
