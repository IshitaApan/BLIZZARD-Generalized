bad decorator for methods which implement abstract methods. [render]

Build 200209031019 In the outline view, the current decorator for a method which implements an abstract method defined in a abstract class is the full triangle, as for a method which overrides an other method. The decorator should be the empty triangle, as for methods which implement other abstract methods (interface methods). Because, as for these methods, it's really an implementation, not an overriding of an other method.
