Remove unnecessary APIs on BindingKey

I20050426-1700 After discussions with JDT/UI, we came to conclusion that the following 3.1 APIs on BindingKey are not suitable; since they may cache element structural information into keys, leaving clients with difficult decisions as to whether to trust the key or the element. - BindingKey#getDeclaringTypeSignature() - BindingKey#toSignature() The only interest for having these APIs on the key is to cache some information avoiding populating the model, and is not mandated by the normal binding key contract, i.e. identify uniquely a type binding. Therefore, they should not be added . If such information was requested again, it should end up in a different spot. Something we could imagine post 3.1 is to precache this information directly into Java elements (pre/partially initialized element infos), and hiding the complexity to clients who could blindly trust the elements to reflect reality.
