[typing] Smart Home/End functionality should be surfaced in Text editor preferences

AbstractTextEditor supports smart home/end navigation (pressing home/end moves to first/last nonwhitespace character) However, the editor has it disabled by default and there's no way to enable it on the UI. According to Bug 28681 comment 2: It is up to the editor implementer to enable it by setting the preference "AbstractTextEditor.Navigation.SmartHomeEnd" in its preference store and eventually provide a UI. And I believe JDT & CDT already do this, and WTP's SSE editors intend to do the same. But shouldn't the text editor just provide the UI to enable or disable this function? And then if an editor implementor wants to do something specific for their own editor, then they most likely already have means to control this preference/function themselves (like using a chained preference store)
