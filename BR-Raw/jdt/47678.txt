Duplicate parameter prefixes in auto-generated JavaDoc comments

Eclipse 3.0 M5. For the variable type 'Parameters' in 'Preferences/Java/Code Generation/Conventions for variable names' select a non-empty Prefix, e.g. p_. If you now add a JavaDoc comment to a method that has a parameter list with already p_-prefixed names, the @param starts with p_p_ what obviously is wrong.
