[package explorer] Focus on active task button disappears from package explorer view

Build ID: 3.3.2 M20080221-1800 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Using Mylyn 2.3.0.v20080225-2200 with the Eclipse build entered, do Windows>Preferences>Java>Appearance and uncheck Show members in package explorer. 2. The toolbar for the package explorer will now have the Focus on Active Task button removed. Not sure that that is intentional, but I hope it is inadvertant. 3. But, definitely a bug imho, is that when you reverse the preference so that you again show members in the package explorer view, the Focus on Active Task button does not reappear. More information: The preference had no effect on the buttons appearance in either the navigator or outline views. I would wish for it to have no effect on the package explorer view as well, or at least that it would toggle with the preference.
