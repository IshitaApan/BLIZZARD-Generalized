[search] for all packages seems hung

I0501 If you pick Navigate->Go To->Package you get a progress dialog up but the progress is already at 100%. It says, Searching... [bar||||] Locating Java matches... It stays that way for a VERY LONG TIME - in a workspace with only 6 projects it was stuck like that for about 3 minutes on a 3Ghz P4. I thought actually it was hung before finally I got a chooser up with the list of packages. Issues: #1: There is no progress indication, it appears hung #2: The cancel button in the progress bar is unresponsive #3: What the heck is it doing with all that time? #4: The resulting list appears wrong. For example, with org.eclipse.ui and org.eclipse.ui.workbench as source projects I get 6 entries for org.eclipse.ui.about which believe I only have one of. I have to assume nobody ever uses this menu, its pretty unusable as is.
