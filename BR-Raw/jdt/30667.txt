create 'subpackage'  when doing create new package with a package selected

It should be possible to quickly create a new package as a subpackage of an already existing package. A suggestion: upon activating the new>package menu from a selected package, the name field in the dialog box could already contain the name of the selected package (possibly with the name completely selected). Just appending a ".foo" would suffice to create a subpackage thereof.
