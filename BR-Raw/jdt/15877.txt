Jar export wizard (driver 020502)

Hi, I really don't know if this is the correct category for this bug. Sorry if I am at the wrong place. The option of saving the "export to jar" wizard settings on a file is really good. The only problem is that if I activate the Jar wizard again (not using the jardesc file) to do an export that I don't to create a jardesc for, all the previous settings are loaded again, including the jardesc file name. Since this information is on the 2nd or 3rd page, I got it rewrite without knowing it. Maybe the export wizard should keep the previous settings only if a jardesc is NOT created (afterall why do I need then persisted between wizard activations if I saved the information?).
