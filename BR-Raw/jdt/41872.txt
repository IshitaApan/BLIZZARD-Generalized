[misc] Outliner doesn't generate selection change event if method changes name

I20030820++ - create class class A { 	public static void bbbb(String[] args) {	 	} } - give focus to package explorer - open editor an A - change method bbbb to main observe: the package explorer receives a selection change event (Refactor- >Rename is disabled). Give focus to the outliner. Refactor->Rename is enabled. I debuged it and the outliner doesn't send out a selection change even in this case. The outliner isn't sorted.
