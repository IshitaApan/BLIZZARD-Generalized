[code manipulation] Comment and uncomment code

The same key ctrl-/ should be used for both comments and uncommenting code. If code isn't commented ctrl-/ will comment. If already commented ctrl-/ will uncomment it. If two levels of comments, uncomment the first, then the second. For example //this is a comment ////this is a second comment hitting ctrl-/ would result in this is a comment //this is a second comment
