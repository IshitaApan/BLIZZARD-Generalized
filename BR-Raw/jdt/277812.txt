[call hierarchy] [working sets] Add F1 Help for Call Hierarchy Filters, Expand With Constructors Dialog, Working Set Configuration Dialog , Working Set Assignments Dialog

Created attachment 137122 Patch with the help doc, and code for enabling the help. Build ID: I20090522-1710 Steps To Reproduce: (Just putting the doc related requests at one place, so that a single patch can be attached) 1) FiltersDialog of the Call Hierarchy has a help button which leads to an "no help defined" popup. The dialog sets it's context help to IJavaHelpContextIds.CALL_HIERARCHY_FILTERS_DIALOG which is never used in the doc plugins. There should at least be a little description of the dialog or the help support in the dialog should be disabled. 2) In addition: - 'Expand with Constructors' dialog has no help yet, standard workbench window help is shown - org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/ref-call-hierarchy.htm: document the new 'Expand with Constructor' feature 3) The 'Working Set Assignments' dialog has no help yet (standard workbench window help is shown). 4) The 'Configure Working Set' dialog has no help yet (standard workbench window help is shown).
