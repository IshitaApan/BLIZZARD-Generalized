[clean up] Save Cleanup action "use_blocks_only_for_return_and_throw" toggles block

Created attachment 104136 Eclipse project that is configured to reproduce the bug. Build ID: I20080530-1730 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a new project; create a class with minimal code containing an if statement with a throws in it. 2. Configure the project to use save actions and configure those save actions to perform additional actions, those additional actions need only have the following on: Code Style -> Use blocks in ... -> Always except for single ... 3. Make a change to the file (anything will do; eg, add a space). Save the file. Braces around if statement will change. Make another change to the file; save; braces around if statement will change again. More information: This bug causes horrible verbosity in project version DIFF reports / SCM commit reports. See attachment for a project that was used to reproduce this bug.
