[1.5] Convert to enhanced for loop quick assist should not be available if counter is used in loop

I20040907 Have the following: for (int i= 0, length= numbers.length; i < length; i++) { 	int number= numbers[i]; 	System.out.println("Number " + i + ": " + new Integer(numbers[i])); } The quick assist allows me to convert this into code which causes a compile error: for (int element : numbers) { 	System.out.println("Number " + i + ": " + new Integer(numbers[i])); } Note: if I first assign int number= numbers[i]; and use number instead of numbers[i] in the println then the quick assist is not offered (correct).
