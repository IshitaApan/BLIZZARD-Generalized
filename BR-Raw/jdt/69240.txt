[reconciling] Editor shows "stale" compilation error

Eclipse has always has a small problem in that occaisionally it would show an error in the editor window (red-squiggly, with a marker) even though the error had been fixed and no longer appeared in the Tasks/Problem view. I usually just type "Space-Backspace" and save the file and it goes away. In 3.0, this is MUCH more frequent. I'm not 100% sure of the cause, but every time I've seen in it recently, file A will have a problem, and then I'll change file B to fix it. I'll pay more attention, and see if I can obtain any more details.
