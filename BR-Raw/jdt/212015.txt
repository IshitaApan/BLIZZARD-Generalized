[quick fix] Inappropriate quick fix for an unecessary else clause

I20071204-1547 I have the following method: public static String getDefaultLocation() { if (Activator.ctx.getProperty("osgi.dev") == null) //$NON-NLS-1$ 	return Platform.getInstallLocation().getURL().getPath(); else 	return Platform.getConfigurationLocation().getURL().getPath() + "selfhostingRoot/"; } And next to the statement of the else block I have the following warning: " Statement unnecessarily nested within else clause. The corresponding then clause does not complete normally". I'm agreeing with this. However I think that two of the 3 following quick fixes will not fix my problem since they will simply create blocks: - change else statement to block - change if-else statements to block - move else clause out of else I would have expected to only get the 3rd quick fix.
