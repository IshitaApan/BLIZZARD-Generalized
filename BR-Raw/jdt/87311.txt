Rename preview UI too large with multiple displays [refactoring] [dialogs]

The Preview window shouldn't be sized to fit the larger display if it actually shows up on the smaller display. OS X 10.3.8, Java 1.4.2. Use two displays of different sizes (laptop 1280 x 854, external monitor 1280 x 1024, menu and dock on the smaller laptop display), two Eclipse windows open, one per display, maximized, containing the same project. Select a java file in Package Explorer on either window and choose Refactor|Rename..., then change the name in the Rename Compilation Unit dialog and select Preview. The preview UI will usually appear centered on the smaller laptop display, but since it is too large it gets clipped on the top and bottom and you cannot access the window title bar (with it's close, maximize and iconize icons), the grow handle in the lower right corner or the Cancel and OK buttons. The scroll bar is also clipped so you cannot view all the items in the original source and refactored source columns. You can still press the escape key to cancel or press return for OK.
