[WorkbenchParts] IWorkbenchPage#hideView(IViewPart) does not always dispose of the view any more

N20050725-0010 IWorkbenchPage#hideView(IViewPart) does not always dispose of the given view any more. I'll describe our findings regarding the failing PackageExplorerTests from org.eclipse.jdt.ui.tests (started to fail in N20050723-0010). This is a major semantic shift that may well affect other clients. Our calling sequence in these tests is this: IWorkbenchPage page= fWorkbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage(); fMyPart= page.showView(...id...); ... page.hideView(fMyPart); fMyPart.dispose(); Previously, IWorkbenchPage#hideView(..) has disposed of all SWT resources associated with the view part. The next invication of IWorkbenchPage#showView(..) then created a new instance of the view. This is no longer the case now. #showView(..) now sometimes returns an old instance of the view part. This is maybe connected to bug 104991. If you don't consider this change a bug in Platform/UI, please advise on how else we can programmatically close a view, such that it is properly disposed and the next #showView(..) creates a new instance.
