[navigation] Open on selection should use just caret location

F3 will attempt to find a type based on the current selection range. If the selection range is length 0, it will take the encompassing "word" and try to find that element. But, if a range is selected, it will try to match based on the selected text. I don't understand when someone would use this latter case. To me, I would prefer to have it always take the caret location, and then search based on the surrounding word, never the selection range. For example, I search for a method containing the word "accessible", and I find a method call to "getAccessible". Now, I want to go to the method declaration using F3, but part of the method name is swiped. I would never want to open the Type "Accessible", but this is what happens.
