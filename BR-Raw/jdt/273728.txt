[BiDi][type wizards] Incorrect representation of complex expressions (like filepath) containing Bidi characters in "Create New ..." wizards.

Build ID: I20090313-0100 Steps To Reproduce: Use the Bidi (Arabic/Hebrew) enabled version of Windows. 1. Start eclipse with following arguments: "-nl en -dir rtl" in workspace "C:\workspace". 2. Select "New->Project", then choose any any project except "General". 3. In "New ....Project" wizard type "ABC" (capital letters stands for Bidi characters) into 'Project name' field. This field now contains: "CBA". Result: The "Directory field contains "CBA\C:\workspace". The correct display should be of course: "c:\workspace\CBA". Remark. This problem has been resolved, for instance, for "General" project ('New Project' page of create project wizard 'New->Project->General->Project'). The built in mechanism for correct processing of complex expressions (like filepath) containing Bidi characters exists in Text processor. More information:
