[build path] Access Restrictions: severity for 'Not accessible' is configurable, but not for 'Discouraged'

I20050329-2000 summary says it all - the problem severity for 'Discouraged' accesses should be configurable as well. Currently, if you set the severity for 'Not accessible' to 'Ignore', you end up with warnings on 'Discouraged' accesses, but nothing for 'Not accessible' ones, which is not intuitive.
