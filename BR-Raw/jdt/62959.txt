Search in enclosing project doesn't take project from editor

200405190010 + JavaSearchScopeFactory.java rev. 1.23 This bug was introduced with the fix of bug 62863. Steps: - have org.eclipse.jface and org.eclipse.swt in your workspace - open TreeViewer and select "Tree" in "private Tree tree;" - press Ctrl+H - Limit To: 'References', Scope: 'Enclosing Project' - click 'Search' button -> was: References found in org.eclipse.swt -> expected: References found in org.eclipse.jface (Editor's project) Expected behavior was present before fix JavaSearchScopeFactory.java rev. 1.23 Already buggy before fix (behavior unchanged): - Context menu > References > Project -> Search view title says "23 References in Project org.eclipse.swt", but references are (correctly) found in org.eclipse.jface.
