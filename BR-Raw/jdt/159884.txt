In synchronize view, some changes are hidden when view is "All Models" or "Java Workspace"

A developer on my team added some files into CVS. I should note that the root folder of the project serves as the source folder, in case that makes any difference. When I do a team>synchronize, I do not see these added files if the view is "All Models" or "Java Workspace". If I change it to "Workspace", I see them. I don't know what the difference between "Java Workspace" and "Workspace" is, but it seems intuitive to me that if something appears when "Workspace" is selected, it should appear when "All Models" is selected. The synchronize view did show the project as having incoming changes, that is the project was present in the synchronize view when in incoming mode, but there was nothing under the project in the tree view.
