[clean up][ui] should indicate selected cleanups on hidden tabs

I20060214-0010 Currently, the user cannot know what clean ups are active without going to every tab. That's a bit tedious for the common use case that you just want to apply a single clean up. One way to milden this problem of hidden active clean ups would be to add the number of active clean ups to the category tabs, e.g. Code Style (1) | Unnecessary Code (0) | Missing Code (0)
