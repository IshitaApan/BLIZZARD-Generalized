[typing] Correct Indentation for '{' is wrong when declaration isn't on a single line

Created attachment 238617 Zipped demo project Starting with Luna M4 I get a very annoying effect in some (not all) Java files. The indentation of some (not all) braces alternates between two different positions whenever I save those files. One position is correct and the other one not. The incorrect one can be fixed with Shift+Ctrl+F but that makes the editor dirty and the next save brings it back to the incorrect brace positions. The alternating behaviour can also be reproduced by adding a space after any line in the file and saving it. I attach a zipped project with a single Java file in it which seems to reproduce it in a fresh workspace. The file is full of compile errors because I stripped down the project but that doesn't impact the problem I describe above. Maybe bug 251824 has caused this regression?
