[preferences] Make  "Fill Argument names..." the default

When you use the Microsoft Office Visual Basic Script editor (I do from time to time) one of the most practical things about it is the tooltip that appears underneath a method when you are adding the parameter values to it, in the following way: myMethodInvocation( ); -------------------------------------------------- | myMethodInvocation(username (String), age(int))| -------------------------------------------------- This is a super-practical feature. You don't have to do <ctrl>+<space> for evey parameter. You select the signature once and as of then the tooltip with the parameternames and types appears underneath the line you're editing.
