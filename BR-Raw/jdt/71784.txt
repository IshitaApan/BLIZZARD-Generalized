[syntax highlighting] deprecated needs a default color

1) enable semantic highlighting 2) enable deprecated highlighting -> the default color is black and no default style There should be a reasonable default style. My first choice would be strikethrough which we currently cannot do. Some dark yellow for "warning" would be my second choice
