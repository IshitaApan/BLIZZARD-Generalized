[jar exporter] create ANT build file for current settings

Created attachment 85683 add export ant button to Runnable JAR File Export Wizard Build ID: I20071127-0800 Steps To Reproduce: 1. File > Export > Java/Runnable JAR File 2. Wizard Page "Runnable JAR File Specification" shows up 3. Enhancement: allow exporting the current settings as ANT build.xml file More information: ANT 1.7 supports all features we need to create runnable jars (zipfilesets inside a jar). Eclipse has integrated ANT 1.7 now, so we can use it to create automated build scripts. I have created a Patch which adds an "Export ANT..." Button to the Wizard. After selecting the save-file-name an ANT script based on the selected launch configuration is created. The Integration into the GUI is not final. Any Ideas how to better integrate the ANT Export is welcome.
