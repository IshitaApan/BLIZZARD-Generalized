[perfs] Performance tests with no results should be removed from test suites

Using 3.3 RC1 perf tests results page: http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.3RC1-200705171700/performance/org.eclipse.jdt.text.php? Looking at Scenario Status Table, several tests have no results and got a '?' after the image. This is due to the fact that there are no results stored in releng performance results database. These tests must be removed from test suites to avoid polluting the component status table... Note that this was the case from a long time as these tests results already were invalid in 3.2.2 performance tests page: http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/R-3.2.2-200702121330/performance/org.eclipse.jdt.text.php? If you follow links on same tests, you'll see that they have neither Elapsed Process nor CPU Time results...
