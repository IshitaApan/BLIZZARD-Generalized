Hierarchy outline has empty space

I opened a hierarchy view on IActionDelegate. Selected a few of the subinterfaces, changed the expansion state of the tree. Then, no matter which item I selected in the top window (the hierarchy tree), the bottom window (the outline table) always had exactly four empty rows before the first item was listed.
