Code Assist does not respect platform line ends

I performed the following scenario: 1. Created a new class 2. Added a method. 3. Defined a local variable for an array 4. Used code assist to create a for loop with temporary variable. The resulting code has LF as linefeeds on a windows machine. They should be CR/LF.
