enhance 'move static' to handle member types [refactoring]

I20030806 - create class package p1; public class A { 	static class Inner { 	} 	public void foo() { 		Inner inner= null; 	}	 } - select Inner in outliner and move it to p2.C observe: - this doesn't seem to be a refactoring since the files stay unsave and there isn't any undo - no references are updated - I can't move the Inner class into another class. Only into a CU.
