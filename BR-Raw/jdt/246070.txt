[content assist] Multiline method invocation with comment at the end of line causes invalid parameters content assist behaviour

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Put in .java these example methods (assume we have here many parameters so wrapping is necessary): private void test(int p1, int p2, int p3, int p4) {} private void invokeTest() { test(1, 2, 3, 4); test(1, 2, // comment e.g. $NON-NLS-like 3, 4); } 2. Invoke parameter content assist (ctrl-shift-space) at first test() method invocation without comment and you'll see hint with parameters' names and current cursor position at which parameter (bolded) 3. Go with right arrow to next parameters, bold in hint will follow even on the next line 4. Invoke content assist at second test method with comment - bold will stop at parameter p3 because of comment. More information: Really annoying, especially after externalize strings where many such comments ($NON-NLS) appeared.
