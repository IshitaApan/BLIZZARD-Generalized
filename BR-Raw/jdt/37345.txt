javaElementFilters extension point isn't robust against errors in the plugin.xml

1) create a javaElementFilters extension, but leave the markup in the plugin.xml incomplete 2) start-up the workbench -> the package explorer doesn't come up The reason is that the javaElementFilters extension point implementation fires an assertion when the xml isn't complete. This is not correct since this isn't a programming error. In addition, an error in the plugin.xml shouldn't never block the workbench from properly coming up.
