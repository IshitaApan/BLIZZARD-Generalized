[package explorer] [working sets] Enable 'New' action for working sets

If I want to create a new folder in a project, I right-click the project. If I want to create a new project in a working set, I right-click the working set... and then remember that it doesn't work that way. I suggest that "New Project" should be enabled from the working set context menu, and the new project should add itself to the working set.
