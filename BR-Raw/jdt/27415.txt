inline method is too scared of compile warnings [refactoring]

20021127 package p; public class A { static final int I= 0; void f(){ int iiiii= I; int j= iiiii; //j++; } void fg(){ f(); } } try inlining fg() - cannot because it complains about the warning. uncomment the commented line and it will make inline method happy
