Type Hierarchy doesn't show all inherited members on focus change

[This *may* be related to http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24177 ] The MethodViewer is not updated when the focus is changed in the HierarchyViewer. Steps to reproduce: - Open (traditional) Type Hierarchy on "IMember" - Ensure that "Show All Inherited Members" is switched on - Select "Member" in the hierarchy - Observe that getElementName() : String - org.eclipse.jdt.core.IJavaElement appears in the list of methods (but not the version from JavaElement: is that a bug or a feature? - I'll file another PR for that one). - Open the context menu on class "Member" in the hierarchy and select "Focus on 'Member'" - Observe that the list of members is NOT updated. - Click on the (selected) class "Member" in the hierarchy - The methods list is updated and includes the overriden version of getElementName() from JavaElement Fazit: the methodsViewer needs to be updated on change of focus Eclipse Version: 2.0 Build id: 200209240928
