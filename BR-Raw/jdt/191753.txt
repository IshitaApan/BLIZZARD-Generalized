[build path] Allow to open classpath container properties from 'Properties' action

Currently if you call Properties action from popup menu (or Alt-Enter on windows) on classpath container (i.e. "JRE System Library") it says "no property pages available". So, you have to go into project properties or open Build Path / Configure Build Path... select container and hit Edit there. Please allow to open classpath container properties from container node in the Package Explorer.
