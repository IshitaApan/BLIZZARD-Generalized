[type hierarchy] Hierarchy View flips orientation multiple times on resize

These steps to reproduce the problem worked for both Kim and I, but the behavior seemed to be sensitive to the size of the shell, and potentially other factors... 1) Start with Java perspective in default layout (i.e. reset perspective). 2) Drag Outline view so that it is below the package explorer. 3) Open the hierarchy view on a class with many methods (e.g. CommonNavigator); make sure hierarchy view is in top left corner. 4) Grab the sash between the hierarchy view and the editor area and slowly drag it back and forth. As you drag the sash past the point where the hierarchy view's orientation flips from horizontal to vertical (or vice versa) and continue dragging in the same direction, you will notice that the orientation flips back and forth several times before settling on the new orientation. The problem appears to be related to the existance of vertical scroll bars in the "method list" part of the hierarchy view. If there are too few methods in the list to need a scrollbar, when the orientation is vertical, the problem does not occur.
