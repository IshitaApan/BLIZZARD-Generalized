[refactoring] dialog lost function - going back from Preview

20030228 it used to be able to go back from the preview it's not possible now it was a very useful feature - i could type some stuff in the input page, see the preview, go back if i didn't like what i saw, fix and keep doing that until i was happy with the result. it is not possible now and all my effort i put into entering input for a refactoring is gone as soon as i press preview (unless i'm lucky and get an error, in which case i can go back <g>) major - messes up my workflow
