[typing] Incorrect indentation in string continuation

HEAD Started with -------------------------------------------------------------------- package p; class A { 	void foo() { 		String[] array ={ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string", 				 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string" 		}; 	} } --------------------------------------------------------------------- Replace 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string"+ 				"this is the 2nd string" with 				"this is the new 2nd string"+ 				"this is the new 2nd string"+ 				"this is the new 2nd string"+ 				"this is the new 2nd string"+ 				"this is the new 2nd string" => Result is ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- package p; class A { 	void foo() { 		String[] array ={ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string"+ 				"this is the 1st string", 				 				"this is the new 2nd string"+ 						"this is the new 2nd string"+ 						"this is the new 2nd string"+ 						"this is the new 2nd string"+ 						"this is the new 2nd string" 		}; 	} } ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- All the lines after the second one are indented by 2. (This works fine if the 1st string is replaced) The concrete use case can be seen in org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.compiler.regression.JavadocBugsTest.testBug128954(). Thanks Olivier for pointing this out.
