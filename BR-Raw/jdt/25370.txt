Linked Mode: Want to define where to focus

20021022 I added a new feature that starts the linked mode on all usages of a variable. e.g. int i; i= 1; i++; would link all 3 occurrences of i, so when edited, all 3 references are changed simultanously. Problem is that the liked mode does not allow me to set the focus (where to edit) to e.g. the 'i' in 'i++'. The linked mode only allows to edit the top most linked position ('int i'). The feature can be invoked on any reference. Jumping to the top not so ideal.
