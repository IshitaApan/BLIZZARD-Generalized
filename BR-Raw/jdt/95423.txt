M7 JDT Open Type Dialog Issues With Multiple 'Identical' Projects

This is a design compliant, but I rate it as critical since it severly affects my teams ability to use Eclipse and the fact that a design change of this magnitude has been introduced so late in the 3.1 release process. Essentially, removing the bottom box for duplicate types across differing open projects makes the dialog unusable when you have many projects open containing the same sets of files. The following is taken for a discussion on the eclipse.tools.jdt newsgroup to save the ideas expressed there: Adam Malter wrote: The way we currently work is that we have 3 or 4 projects for each of our releases on the subversion tree. For example, I currently have checked out and are working on the TRUNK, UPDATE, and MINOR branches of our product. These branches correspond to differing release times and all changes get eventually reapplied to the TRUNK. Due the size of our product (each project is approx 42,102 resources, maybe 2/3 of those java and jsp files) opening and closing the projects is way too time consuming, even with the performance enhancements in this latest release. So, I usually just leave all three open. So.... Now when I type in say 'PurchaseOrder' to the open type dialog I get a list of 3 PurchaseOrder's, then a list of 3 PurchaseOrderImpl's, then a list of 3 PurchaseOrderAmendment's, then a ... well, you get it.. It's impossible to find just the files for the project your looking for and the danger of accidently opening a source from the incorrect project is amplified. In the old open type dialog, you just had to remember how many 'tabs' down in the bottom window the project you were working on was. So, is there a setting someplace to revert to the old open type dialog? Or, is it possible to restrain the open type dialog to just the project your working on (without closing the other projects?

I would actually prefer that the search dialog just prefixed each type with the project name they are from if there is more than one with the same name (should be enough for most cases, only not supporting the case where you have the same class in different .jar files) -max ------------------------------------------------------------------- Konstantin Scheglov wrote: Max Rydahl Andersen: On Mon, 16 May 2005 02:04:33 +0200, Adam Malter <amalter@illegalcheese.com> wrote: So....

Agree, but it should be in a different columns: class name in the first, package name in the second. Also some another optional columns may be added: project name, file location and so on. -- Alexander Mitin
