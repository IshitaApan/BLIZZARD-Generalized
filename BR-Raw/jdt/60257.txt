SearchPattern API: R_CASE_SENSITIVE vs. boolean isCaseSensitive

The SearchPattern API for stringPattern searches to java elements is somewhat odd: There's a public constant R_CASE_SENSITIVE, which is not mentioned in the javadoc of createPattern(String stringPattern, int searchFor, int limitTo, int matchMode, boolean isCaseSensitive) , and there's also an extra boolean parameter isCaseSensitive. I don't see why R_CASE_SENSITIVE is made public if it should not be used by clients. On the other hand, it could also be turned into an official bit-flag and the boolean isCaseSensitive removed. To have both options seems strange to me.
