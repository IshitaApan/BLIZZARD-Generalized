[Viewers] Open Call Hierarchy fails to find callers sometimes [call hierarchy]

1. Place the cursor on a method or constructor name that is called from one or more places in the code. 2. Select Open Call Hierarchy from the context menu. At this point the Call Hierarchy view should show all the callers of the selected method. Since I installed 3.1M4 (upgraded from 3.1M3) I have noticed that sometimes only the selected method is shown in the Call Hierarchy view. If I run the operation a second time, all the expected callers show up in the Call Hierarchy view. The same is sometimes true when expanding a caller node. The expanded node may appear empty, but after rerunning the operation, that node will exand to show its callers. As of yet, I have not recognized any pattern to make the problem consistently reproducible.
