[misc] Accidental  clicking "Show Source of Selected Element Only" causes confusion

On the newsgroups I have seen many people (mostly beginners) complaining about not seeing full cource of their classes. It always turns out that they accidentally clicked the "Show Source of Selected Element Only" toolbar button. Here are few possible enhancements: 1. When the "Show Source of Selected Element Only" is clicked show a message dialog indicating how to get out of the state. The dialog could have "Do not show this message" checbbox. The message showing behaviour should be recoverable from the Java:Editor preferences page. Alternatively: 2. Make "Show Source of Selected Element Only" a preference. 2.1 Move "Show Source of Selected Element Only" to a submenu under Source i.e. making it difficult to get into. It should be possible for an expert to show it on the toolbar also. 3. Always indicate the state in the editor - a label at top with instructions on how to get out of the state. Or a icon on the Editor tab with a tooltip showing how to get out of the state.
