[refactoring] cannot pull up method from implementation to interface

I have a simple class Clazz implementing an interface Interfaze. I've written a new instance method in Clazz and now want to pull it up to Interfaze, but Eclipse does not allow me: "Pull up is not allowed on this type. Type has no super types.". Of course it has - the Interfaze.
