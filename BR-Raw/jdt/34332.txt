Spurious JUnit View Opens in Debug Perspective

Using RC2. This is a wierd one, so please for give me if this is working as designed. 1. Write and run HelloWorld.java. 2. Open the Debug perspective. 3. Notice that the Console and Task views are correctly stacked in place. 4. Select the terminated process and choose "Remove All Terminated" from the context menu. 5. Notice that the JUnit view appears stacked with the Console and Task view. Quite why this would happen I cannot say. Clearly I suspect this to be a bug.
