(automatic) Global Replace

Currently it is only possible to do a global replace, by first searching and then replace each occurrence manually. While this ensures that nothing is accidentally replaced, it is awful if you have use cases like the following: - I want to replace "DAO" to "Dao" and "XML" to "Xml" in all methods, classes, attributes, local variables etc. - I want to replace the copyright in all files - I want to replace all 'Ã¤' (german special character) to "ae" or "&auml;" - I want to rename all classes that end with "Helper" to "Service" These kinds of things happen quite frequently if you incorporate code from one project into another because the responsibility for the code has changed or after a merger of two groups/companies. Often these to groups had different style guides that should now be consolidated. Or imagine taking over the ORO and the OJB stuff in the Jakarte project. And even if it would be better to have refactorings, a pragmatic approache sounds much better to me.
