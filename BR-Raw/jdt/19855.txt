Test class not found in project [JUnit]

Is this a bug or am I missing something? I have a class which the JUnit Failure Trace window seems unable to GoTo, instead bringing up an error dialog which reads, "Test class not found in project". Steps: [1] Run a JUnit launch configuration which has failures. [2] In the failures tab, select "test_mumble". Right-menu/GoTo has the expected, correct behavior. [3] In the Failure Trace window below, I see the stack trace. I can double click or right-menu/GoTo all but one of the line in this window that correspond to my code, and be taken to the appropriate code position. For this trace, however, I cannot double click or use right-menu/GoTo for the method which raised an assert exception. If I try, I get the "Test class not found in project" error. I should point out that the assert is not being raised in test code, but in an unimplemented stub. Possibly relevant: The actual assert is in a method of a static inner class, said method looking roughly like 		double[] apply(double[] vectorIn, Space space) { 			assert false : "nyi"; 			return null; 		}
