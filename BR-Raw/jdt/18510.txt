ClassFileEditor leaks

In the 0530 build the leaks with the .java editor appear to have been fixed. The scenario I was using before: Create a .java file, close it. In memory profiler do a global GC and mark objects Open the same .java file, close it Does not leave tons of objects around anymore. However, if you import a binary plugin (I did this by importing all plugins) and open the .class file there is a significant leak. To recreate: Select a .class file (I used junit.awtui.AboutDialog.cass) from the junit.jar Open/Close it. Do a global GC, snapshot Open/Close the .class editor Do a global GC
