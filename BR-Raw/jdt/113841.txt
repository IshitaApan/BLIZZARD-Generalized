[type hierarchy] Long UI freeze when clicking in outline after starutp

Build id: I20051025-0800 1) Running a large self-hosting workspace, in java perspective, with an editor open and the outline view is visible. 2) Shutdown and restart Eclipse. -> After startup, the "Initializing Java User Interface is running". That's fine. 3) Left-click a method in the outline view. -> At this point the UI froze for about ten seconds. I captured a stack trace, and it looks like the OpenSuperImplementationAction.selectionChanged method is causing type hierarchy computations, and this must have been conflicting with the initialization job and/or background decoration. It seems building type hierarchies in response to selection changed is too eager... I didn't even open the context menu in this case, I just wanted to view the method in the editor. I will attach the stack dump.
