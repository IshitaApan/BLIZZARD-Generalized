[painting] Mark Occurrences: sporadic random highlights when editing javadoc

Mark Occurrences sometimes highlights random text while I am typing in a javadoc comment. I will attach a GIF image for an example. In this example, I was typing on the second line of the comment (the line ending in "thi"), and the highlights suddenly appeared. I cannot come up with any rationale for the areas that are highlighted; in particular, I had only changed a couple lines in this file, so it's not like it's highlighting tokens in a slightly out-of-date version of the file. Note that the highlights include whitespace, It is not reproducible, not even immediately after it happens. That is, if I am typing along and the random highlights suddenly appear, and I delete and then re-enter a few characters, they will not reappear. I have not been able to figure out a reliable repro case, but I'm not the only person on my team that is affected by this. Will add info if more becomes available.
