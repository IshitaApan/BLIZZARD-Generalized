[clean up] clean up on save does too much if 'Additional actions' is unchecked

I20090506-2000. Clean up on save does too much if 'Additional actions' is unchecked: instead of just creating the import and format clean ups it creates and loops over all of them (but with disabled options). This can lead to nasty side effects up to executing other clean ups. Test Case: 1. import the attached project into your workspace 2. start target workspace 3. open a CU 4. change it 5. save ==> bad clean up is executed (see first line ;-)
