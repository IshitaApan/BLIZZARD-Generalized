[Preferences] Want to create an instanceof of a WorkingCopyManager

20050405 I'm currently referencing the internal class org.eclipse.ui.internal.preferences.WorkingCopyManager I have a base class that manages all the current settings and I changes that class to use the working copy manager. For the following reasons I also have to function when I don't get a working copy manager. To avoid complicated code it would be nice if in these case I could just use an internal instance of the working copy manager. - In the preference page, when testing if my container is really of kind IWorkbenchPreferenceContainer (so I can access the working copy manager) I have to also handle the case that the test returns false - We have some pages that are contributed by extension point that don't give me access to the container due to API limitations.
