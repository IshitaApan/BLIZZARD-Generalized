Cleanup CodeFormatterUtil

3.3 RC1. CodeFormatterUtil is internal and hence we should clean it up so that there's only reformat and format. We should ensure that all our code that formats goes through the CodeFormatterUtil and not go directly to JDT Core (like e.g. the comment formatter currently does).
