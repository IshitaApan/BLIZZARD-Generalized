Debugger Source Lookup page claims project is closed

I have a Java project in my workspace, and it is not closed. Upon starting the workbench, Project->Properties->Debugger Source Lookup, the page claims that debugger source lookup is not available for closed projects. If I force a build of the project, it works as expected. If I close the workbench and restart, I get the same problem. 20011106
