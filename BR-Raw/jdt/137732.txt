[new type wizard] [api] addStaticImport to NewTypeWizardPage.ImportsManager

20060420 For the new JUnit 4 test case wizard which extends NewTypeWizardPage and uses the ImportsManager I would like to add a new API ImportsManager.addStaticImport so a static import "static import org.junit.Assert.*" can be added to the created class. ImportsManager cannot be extended (nor instantiated). The API addition is therefore completly safe/non breaking. Erich, can give the PMC approval?
