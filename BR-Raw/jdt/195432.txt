[quick fix] Java access restriction quickfix should be taken over by PDE

3.3 final While tweaking some import/export in manifest I ended up with the following error "Access restriction: The type Picker is not accessible due to restriction on required project org.eclipse.equinox.prov.director". This is fine and I understand why, however the quick fix being proposed in this case is not acceptable since it propose to open the java build path property page to configure acccess rule. Why is it unacceptable? Because we go great length with bells and whistle and communication effort to tell people not to tweak their classpath manually and the first thing we tell them in the quick fix to do otherwise.... Instead I would have expected the quick fix to tell me to add the import that I was missing.
