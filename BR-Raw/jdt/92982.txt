[1.5][compiler] Bounds and erasure of capture and type variable bindings

I20050426-1700 I'm a bit confused about bounds and erasure of capture, type variable and wildcard bindings. Consider this example: public class Try<T extends Collection> { 	void m() { 		List<? extends Collection> wild= null; 		Collection c= wild.get(0); 		 		List<T> var= null; 		Collection c2= var.get(0); 	} Calling ITypeBinding#getBounds() on the type bindings of expressions wild.get(0) and var.get(0) currently returns java.lang.Object as first bound of the capture / type variable bindings. => Why is the first bound not Collection (as in JLS3 / java.lang.reflect)? ITypeBinding#getErasure() says it "returns the binding for the erasure of the leftmost bound ...", but for the bindings from above, it returns Collection. => Javadoc and implementation not in sync.
