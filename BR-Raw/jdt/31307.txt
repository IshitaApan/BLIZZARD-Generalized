Preview in "Push Down" flickers distractingly

- open "Push Down" dialog for a method that calls a private method - press "Preview" -> You get some errors. - scroll through the errors using the next action in the upper right corner -> the preview is first feeded with the new document and caret offset 0 and then reposition to the error offset. This is distracting. setRedraw should be called around the two method invocations.
