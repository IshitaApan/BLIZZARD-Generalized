call hierachy takes long to prune frequent method names

M7 As discussed with Tobias - sizeable workspace (e.g. eclipse development) - create a CU A.java: public class A { public String getName(){return null;} } - caret on 'getName', invoke the call hierarchy > it takes quite a while (0.5 - 1 minute in my case) to find that there are no callers of the method > I assume this is because there are many false positive method matches reported by the search engine that need to be pruned. > The query taking so long is bad from the user's viewpoint because he knows that this class is not used in many places and there cannot be many callers of the method
