[projection] expose projection model updater on JavaEditor

The new API for toggling folding (bug 112586) has almost allowed Mylar to get rid of it's custom folding provider (a duplicate of the default Java one), which will make it play much better with the custom providers that some our users have installed (e.g. coffee bytes). The one missing bit is that we need to get our hands on the IJavaFoldingStructureProviderExtension for a JavaEditor when that editor is opened, in order to supply it to the mechanism that will control the folding for that editor. This is not an API request, just one to open things up a bit in this internal class until we eventually figure out what the API could be. What would be ideal is to have the following public method on JavaEditor: getFoldingStructureProvider() We would be casting this down to IJavaFoldingStructureProviderExtension, so a method returning that would suffice too. Alternatively fProjectionModelUpdater could be made a protected field, but that would not be as good because it forces Mylar to have it's own two subtypes of the JavaEditor which is what we're in the process of getting away from. I don't have a use case other than Mylar, but can imagine other tools for browsing/visualizing code wanting to be able to expand and collapse programmatically using IJavaFoldingStructureProviderExtension.
