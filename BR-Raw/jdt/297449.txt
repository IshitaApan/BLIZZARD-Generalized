[ccp] Can't copy files out of a JAR

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: 20090920-1017 When I open a JAR in the Package Explorer, then the following options in the context menu are disabled: - Copy - Copy Qualified Name (might make sense but it would be nice to be able to copy the full path) "Paste" is enabled though (didn't try what happens ...) Also, there are no properties of any kind associated with the file. I'd at least expect the name, size, path and possibly the modification time. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open "JRE System Library" in any Java project 2. Navigate to "rt.jar" and open it. 3. Navigate to META-INF and open it. 4. Right click on "MANIFEST.MF".
