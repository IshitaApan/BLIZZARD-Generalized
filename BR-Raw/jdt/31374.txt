Package Explorer does not show children of linked directories

Build: RC0 Package explorer view now shows non-Java projects, however if these projects have linked folders, it does not show what is in these linked folders. 1. Start with a fresh workspace. 2. File->Import...->External plug-ins and fragments-> Uncheck the copy option (i.e. import with linking) -> select org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.swt.win32 - >Finish 3. The org.eclipse.swt project should have a Java nature while the other one should not. 4. Expand org.eclipse.swt.win32 (ie. the non-Java project) in the Package Explorer view. You will see the 'os' and 'ws' folders, but you cannot see what they contain. You can only see their contents in the Resource view.
