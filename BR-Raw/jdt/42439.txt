Moving a private static method should change the visibility [refactoring]

class A has a private static method f(). I realize that I could reuse that elsewhere, and in fact, it has little to do with A, but is simply used from there. So, I create a "util" class B to hold that method. I use Refactor-Move. Because this private method was called from A, it worked. After the refactoring, it's now private to B, and the call to A cannot compile. Therefore, this type of move should change the visibility of the method. When A & B are in different packages, clearly it should be public. When they're in the same package, perhaps a dialog should be popped up with a choice. The "visibility choice dialog" might also be desirable when A & B are related, though I haven't thought that through. P.S. Would be really slick if I could specify a new class as part of the Move.
