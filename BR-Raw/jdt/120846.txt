[hierarchy] Jar Export/Import with refactorings fails when renaming type and similar elements

I20051214-0010 - new workspace, import junit3.8.1 source - new project JUnitTests - move all junit.tests* and junit.samples* packages to JUnitTests - export JUnit into junit1.jar with refactoring annotations - import the junit1.jar as file into JUnitTests and add to build path - rename Test to Toast, enable updating similar, with 3rd strategy - export JUnit to junit2.jar - import junit2.jar into JUnitTests => Error message: "Assertion failed: Search for method declaration did not find original element" -> There should be a log entry for such failures -> The refactoring should work ;-)
