[refactoring] Change Method Signature removes comment between parameter type and name

Build N20050303-0010 I started with this method: public void packetReceived( final RoutedPacket pkt, final PktNodeInfo fromNode, final PktNodeInfo toNode, final BitVector/*64*/sendTime, final BitVector/*64*/recvTime) Note that there is a comment instead of a space between the type BitVector and the argument name. While I would prefer a space, the current Eclipse formatter does not leave one. (I believe at one point it used to put a space before the comment and a newline after, which was arguably worse.) However, the formatter is not the issue here. Now, I want to use the Change Method Signature to replace those BitVector arguments with long arguments. Here's what it produces: public void packetReceived( final RoutedPacket pkt, final PktNodeInfo fromNode, final PktNodeInfo toNode, final longsendTime, final longrecvTime) Note that the comment is gone (which is fine with me, but maybe not right in all sitations), but there is no space to separate the tokens.
