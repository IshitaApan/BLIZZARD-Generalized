[call hierarchy] Allow to pin Call Hierarchy

Build Identifier: I20100225-1936 After I remove some methods from the 'call hierarchy view', open another call hierarchy and then go back in history, the removed methods come back (this is quite annoying and renders the 'remove from view' functionality ineffective ). This happens because the hierarchy is computed again while going back in history. I would prefer an implementation similar to 'Search view' where the history is remembered completely (including the removed from view items) and I can hit 'F5' to search again if the results could have changed since the last search. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Steps - Open Call hierarchy of method A - Remove some methods from the call hierarchy view - Open Call hierarchy of method B - Go back in history to view hierarchy of Method A -> the removed methods are back
