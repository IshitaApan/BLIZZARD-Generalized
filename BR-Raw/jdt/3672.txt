DCR: Add working set support

Would be nice to have the VAME Search "Scope" feature. 	This allows the user to filter searches, which reduces both the time to do the search, 	and the number of results found - so that more of the results are known to be useful. 	In VAME, the user could edit a search scope (for example, only search in these 3 projects), 	and give it a name (for example "SWT"), and then the named scope would show up in all 	of the search context menus, for example, if a class was selected, the context menu would 	allow searches on: 		- References	[to the class] 				-> Workspace	[in the whole workspace] 				-> Hierarchy		[in the current hierarchy (the one the class is in)] 				-> Project			[in the current project (the one the class is in)] 				-> SWT				[in the user- defined set of projects named "SWT" - this is the "search scope" or "scope set"] 		- Declarations [of the class] 				-> Workspace 				-> Hierarchy 				-> Project 				-> SWT 	Also, the search dialog would allow temporary scopes to be specified for each individual search. 	See the VAME Searching for more details. (or ask me - I use search a lot - CM) 	Currently, all searches in Eclipse are done on the whole workspace. This is sub-optimal. NOTES: EG (5/17/01 11:12:48 AM) 	Missing working sets to. Can't be done for June. DM (10/4/01 3:07:48 PM) 	Added "Selection" scope DM (10/9/01 9:31:44 AM) 	Will now have to add temporary implementation for working sets: 		IWorkingSet 		WorkingSet -> IWorkingSet 		WorkingSetSelectionDialog 			WorkingSetContentProvider 			WorkingSetLabelProvider
