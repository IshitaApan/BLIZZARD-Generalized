JUnit plugin ignores custom environment settings [JUnit]

The JUnit plugin ignores any custom environment variables in the debug configuration. I've made the necessary changes in the Environment settings to add the path to a custom JNI library I'm using, but the plugin doesn't incorporate these into the runtime debug environment properly. I've verified that my settings work fine in normal debug mode and inspected the java.library.path system property to confirm the missing path entries. This bug may be related to bug #60243 I'm using Eclipse version 3.0 M8
