[misc] No Quick Fix Affordance for APT build makers

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug 170692 comment 10 +++ Hi Walter, thanks for pointing me to this bugzilla. I have post the following question in the JDT newsgroup, if anyone of you think that the fix for this bugzilla would noe help my scenario, please let me know. "I have created my own AnnotationProcessor, QuickFixProcessor, MarkerResolutionGenerator. In my AnnotationProcessor, I have some EclipseMessanger.printFixableError calls in it. I found that the little light bulb (indicating quick fix available) only appears in the Java editor if the printFixableError is being called during the Phase.RECONCILE stage of the annotation processing. I could not get it to appear if the errors are only reported during the Phase.BUILD phase. I have designed the annotation processor reporting a subset of errors during Phase.BUILD stage because the calculations are expensive. Is there a way for me support this?"
