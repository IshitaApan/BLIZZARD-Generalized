Preferences 'Output Folder Name' needs to allow '/' in the path [build path]

In the window/preferences/Java/New Project panel, when 'Folders' radio button is set, the 'output folder name' cannot be set to something like 'WEB- INF/classes'. The error message "'/' is an invalid character" appears. However, when setting the output path on the project (project/properties), 'WEB- INF/classes' is allowed, as the '/' is valid. Please change the window/preferences to allow a '/' in output folder name, so this value can be set by default.
