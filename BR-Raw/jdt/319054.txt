Eclipse deletes all files when I cancel a project creation (symlink in project location path)

Build Identifier: 20100218-1602 There were a directory (named "prj_it") which had the following structure: aub_o/ bin/ KNF/ src/ The path for prj_it in my file system is: /home/mateus/dev/prj_it In /home/mateus there is also a symbolic link (named "prj_it") that points to dev/prj_it I tried to create a new Java project, using "prj_it" as base. ("Create project from existing source") I selected the symbolic link prj_it (/home/mateus/prj_it) as the path to the project. It appears the message: "The output folder has changed. Do you want to remove the old location 'prj_it/bin' and its content?" So I selected to cancel and I clicked in the "Back" button. Then all files in all subdirectories of prj_it were gone! The subdirectories (aub_o, bin, KNF, and src) are still there, but now they are empty. If I select the complete path (/home/mateus/dev/prj_it) instead of the symbolic link, that error does not happen. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on menu File -> New -> Java Project 2. Select the option "Create project from existing source" 3. Click on "Browse" button 4. Select a symbolic link that points to the desired directory and click on "OK" button 5. Click on "Next >" button It will appear the message: "The output folder has changed. Do you want to remove the old location 'prj_it/bin' and its content?" 6. Click on "Cancel" button 7. Click on "< Back" button
