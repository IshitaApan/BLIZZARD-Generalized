[content assist] "Error accessing compilation unit" when using code assist for files not contained in a Java project

Steps to reproduce: 1) Set up a CVS repository connection. 2) Locate an existing Java project in the CVS repository. Right click on the HEAD branch of the project and choose "Check Out as Project". 3) Navigate to the Resource perspective and open a Java source file in the newly created project. In my project, all source files are found under the "src" subdirectory. 4) Navigate within the source file to any function. Start typing the following (slowly) to trigger the code assist functionality: System. 5) An error popup is shown. The title of the error window is "Error Accessing Compilation Unit", and the message shown in the error window is "Cannot access compilation unit. Reason: <project_name> does not exist." where "<project_name>" is the name of the checked out project in step 2. This message appears every time the code assist functionality is invoked, which makes it difficult to edit Java code in a CVS project.
