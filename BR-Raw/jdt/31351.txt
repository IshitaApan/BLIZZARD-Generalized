"Extrude" is not a good name for the quick assist

build I20030206 We should not use "extrude" to describe this quick assist. "extrude" means forcing (often through some device) to produce something. We should find a brief phrase to describe the operation and use it instead. I assume we are avoiding extract since it is used in the various refactorings. This assist causes the program to behave differently - it should be clear from the description that the transformation has this characteristic.
