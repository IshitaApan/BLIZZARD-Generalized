"Link with Editor" in Java Outline should link on activation

I normally work with "Link with Editor" switched off. When editing a long method whose head is out of view, I want to know in which method I am without leaving the editing position. I'd like to *double*click on "Link with Editor" in the Java Outline to synchronize it with the current position (the second click just disables "Link with Editor" again). This works nicely with the Package Explorer, where a doubleclick on "Link with Editor" reveals the current file. I think this doubleclick behavior should be consistently supported by all "Link with Editor" actions.
