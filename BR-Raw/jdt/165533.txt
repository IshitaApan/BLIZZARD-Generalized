[rulers] expanded ruler icons don't perform any action when clicked

Hi, I'm having the following issue since quite some time (before 3.3). When "Expand vertical ruler icons upon hovering" is enabled in the preferences of the Java editor, everything runs nicely unless I want to click on one of the symbols in the expanded pane. What happens then is that the main application window looses focus for just a glimpse of time and the little icon pane disappears again but nothing else happens. In that case the tooltips that accompany the ruler icons on hovering don't get discarded either. I hope I could make myself clear thx
