Java file icons too fat in editor tabs

Eclipse 20020508 All platforms 1) Open a .txt file. 2) Open a .java file Look at the space between the edge of the tab and the image and the edge of the image and the start of the text. The image used for *.java has extra space on the left and right edges. This is using up pixels that would be better used for displaying the file name.
