[jar exporter] JAR from build path not exported when creating a JAR

Build Identifier: 20090920-1017 When exporting data into a jar, I had a strange error. I have a 'lib' dir with three .jars which should all included in the created jar, but none of them is included in the created jar if I mark all three. If I mark just one or two of them, the selected libs are included. If I use a jardesc the three entries for file path=... are wrapped together to folder path=... but none of the jars in the lib dir is included, if I choose just one or two of them, the entries stay file path=... and the jars are included. I fixed it by copying an superfluous jar from another project into the lib dir, as it would always be skipped, the file path=... entries are not wrapped together and it works. But the possible lacking of files caused me to think of it as a major bug. The same jardesc works under Windows 7. Completely confused, Sebastian Reproducible: Always
