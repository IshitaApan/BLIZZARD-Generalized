ImageDescriptorRegistry must empty hash map in dispose

Current code is: public void dispose() { for (Iterator iter= fRegistry.values().iterator(); iter.hasNext(); ) { 	Image image= (Image)iter.next(); 	image.dispose(); } } Statement fRegistry.clear() missing after dispose Current implementation doesn't cause harm since calling dispose on a dispose image is ignored. Must be fixed after M3
