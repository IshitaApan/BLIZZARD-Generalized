[refactoring] Comment deleted on 'Move type to new file' refactoring

For each code snippet below - Move X to new file (problem is independent creating an instance variable) - The comment gets deleted. Its neither in new file nor the old file. - There can be some empty lines between the comment and class X, the comment will still be deleted However if the comment is a javadoc (begins with /**) then its moved to new file. Marking as major as there is loss of data and the user may not realize it right away. Also I do not see any junits which test these (comments) cases. 1) package p; class A { 	/* 	 * A very important comment. 	 */ 	class X { 	} } 2) package p; class A { 	/* 	 * A very important comment.	 	 */ 	 	 		 	class X { 	} 	 } 3) package p; class A { 	// A very important comment. 	 		 	class X { 	} 	 } 4) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	} 	// A very important comment. 	 } 5) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	}	 	/* A very important comment.*/ 	 } 6) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	}	 	/** A very important comment.*/ 	 } Things that work fine - Javadoc comment before Class X Empty lines between Class X and the comment when comment occurs after the class 1) package p; class A { 	/** 	 * A very important comment. 	 */ 	class X { 	} } 2) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	} 	 // A very important comment. 	 } 3) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	}	 	 /* A very important comment.*/ 	 } 4) package p; class A {	 		 	class X { 	}	 	 /** A very important comment.*/ 	 }
