[quick assist] Ctrl+1 on missing Javadoc is 'Rename in file' first which wouldn't actually fix the problem

Created attachment 185130 Screenshot depicting the problem in question. I20101208-1300 (3.7) 1. Have your compiler preferences set to warn/error out with missing/malformed Javadoc. 2. Declare a method that throws an exception. 3. Try to use Ctrl+1 to fix your javadoc, the first proposal is 'Rename in file' which is not really helpful. Please see attached.
