SelectionButtonDialogFieldGroup accesses unitialized field

I0426, found with FindBugs Line 68 in SelectionButtonDialogFieldGroup looks like: if (fButtonsStyle == SWT.RADIO) { But fButtonsStyle is guaranteed to be 0 at this point since it hasn't been initialized yet. This should probably either be "buttonsStyle", or not done until after "fButtonsStyle= buttonsStyle;".
