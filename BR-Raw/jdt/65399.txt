changing a "Run a Single Test" configuration into "Run All Tests in..." does not run all tests [JUnit]

First I ran a single test (by selecting the test method and then choosing Run/JUnit Test from its context menu actions). Then I decided to run all tests in the package instead. So inside the Launching Configurations dialog I chose the option “Run All Tests in selected project, package or folder” and selected the package which contained the test class I had previously selected. Surprisingly it did not run all tests in the package I chose in the previous dialog, rather it ran only the same test from which I created that initial launching configuration. This is a bug which users are very likely to encounter: initially they will want to run a single test and then change their mind and try to run all tests within the corresponding package. 3.0 RC1 Build id: 200405290105
