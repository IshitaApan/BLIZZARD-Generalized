PackageExplorer creation very slow

in RC1 we were testing the big workspace "dev" scenario. starting the big workspace with a resources, Java and Debug perspective open in their standard configurations. There is also a Java editor open (int he Java perspective) on CoreException.class) On my machine starting up this configuration takes 17500ms (in 2.1.3 it takes 12300ms). If I close the PackageExplorer in 3.0 takes 11875ms (and 2.1.3 takes 10953ms). The net being that on 3.0 the PackageExplorer is taking 5200ms to open whereas in 2.1.3 it took about 900ms). I have not had a chance to look much deeper. Perhaps you can supply some insight as to what is expected here. Note that this is not just a startup phenomena. Opening a PackageExplorer after the fact is also very slow.
