[package explorer] package explorer does not always show task working sets

Mylyn's task working sets may contain projects as well as Mylyn queries. The package explorer working sets configuration dialog only lists these working sets if they contain projects only. Once a task working set is made visible it is possible to add queries to it and it will remain to be visible. It would be better if the behavior was consistent and task working sets would always be selectable (i.e. if they contain at least one project). The corresponding filtering code checks if all elements are adaptable to IProject and not just at least one: 	WorkingSetConfigurationDialog$Filter.isCompatible(IWorkingSet) line: 117	 (The work around to make a task working set visible in the package explorer is to remove all queries from it and add at least one project, select it in the package explorer working set configuration dialog, and then add the queries back to the working set.)
