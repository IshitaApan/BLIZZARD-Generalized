IE6 causes conflict with SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL on Windows 98

Build 20020531 When IE 6 is installed on Windows 98 it replaces the task bar with one of its own (according to Dave Thomson). When this occurs the focus behaviour of shells with modality set to SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL changes. STEPS 1) Start Windows 98 on a machine with IE 5 or earlier 2) Select a file 3) Hit delete - a prompter comes up 4) Select an non Eclipse window and drag it over the dialog 5) Select the Eclipse parent window in the tasks list - the dialog and window are given focus 6) Start Windows 98 on a machine with IE 62) Select a file 3) Hit delete - a prompter comes up 4) Select an non Eclipse window and drag it over the dialog 5) Select the Eclipse parent window in the tasks list - the dialog only is given focus and the window stays in the backgroud. I don't have a good pure SWT example of this yet as I am still trying to find the condition that makes this happen.
