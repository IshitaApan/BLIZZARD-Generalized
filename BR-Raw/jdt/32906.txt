Open (in) Type Hierarchy: expansion state is inconsistent across the modes 'show type/supertype/subtype hierarchy' [type hierarchy]

case 1: - select 'show type hierarchy' in the hierarchy view - in an editor press F4 on a class name -> 'show type hierarchy' is ok -> 'show supertype hierarchy' is collapsed -> 'show subtype hierarchy' is ok case 2: - select 'show supertype hierarchy' - in an editor press F4 on a class name -> 'show supertype hierarchy' is ok -> 'show type hierarchy' is only expanded down to the focused type, this is inconsistent with case 1 -> 'show subtype hierarchy' is collapsed case 3: - select 'show subtype hierarchy' - in an editor press F4 on a class name -> 'show subtype hierarchy' is only expanded to level 1 (which is consistent but impractical) -> 'show supertype hierarchy' is collapsed -> 'show type hierarchy' is only expanded down to the focused type, this is inconsistent with case 1
