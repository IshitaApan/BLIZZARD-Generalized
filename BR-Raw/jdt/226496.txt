[Package Exlorer] Filter 'empty packages' does not show packages with non-Java files

Created attachment 95516 Package View with filter activated Build ID: I20080330-1350 (3.4M6) A) Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a Java package that contains only resources (e.g. a .jelly scripts). 2. Set Package Representation to 'flat' 3. Set Filter 'Empty Packages' -> Now the Package with the resources disappears B) Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a Java package that contains only resources (e.g. a .jelly scripts). 2. Set Package Representation to 'hierarchical' 3. Set Filter 'Empty Packages' -> Now the Package with the resources disappears In Eclipse 3.3 you could use the filter for packages that contain only resources! Is there a configuration somewhere, which files should be considered for the empty package filter? Note: A and B are quite different: if I put a Messages.properties into the package above, then in A there still is no package visible, in B I see the package!
