Java Model Exception when creating a project from scratch

I launched Eclipse 2.1 from a brand new Workspace and from there, created a Java project (called "Works") by pointing Eclipse to the root of my project. The process fails after a short while (whether I press Next or Finish after the first page of the wizard) with a dialog telling me to look at the log. I included the top of the log below (it's about 8k, I can post it in its entirety if there's interest). The error is Java Model Exception: Java Model Status [Works does not exist.] I get the same problem with Eclipse 3.0 M1: I can't create a new project.
