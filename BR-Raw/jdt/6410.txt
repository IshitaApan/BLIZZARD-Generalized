File unchanged but dirtied by code assist

1122. Open a Java file. Place the cursor inside the left-most parenthesis of a method call. For example, consider "I" to be the cursor below: Object o = anotherObject.method(I); Press Ctrl-Space. The file is dirtied but not changed, and code assist does not appear. If code assist has nothing to suggest, it should not dirty the file.
