Enable conditional loading of APT

I20060125 When developping 1.4 code in Eclipse running on a 5.0 SDK the APT UI plug-in gets loaded (activated state) through ContributedProcessorDescriptor#getProcessor(ICompilationUnit).. It should only be loaded when needed. The JDT UI extension point should allow to express the required source level. See also bug 125291.
