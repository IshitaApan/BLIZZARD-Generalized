[build path] New Project wizard: execution environment default not alligned with other values

I20070320-0010. The new option to choose an execution environment has its value hard coded. This is not understandable for the user as the other two default values are always set based on the default JRE. I see three different solutions: - allow to globally set the default EE (like we have the default JRE) and use it - compute the EE that best matches the default JRE - remember the last value If the wizard remembers the last used value then my next user question would be: why aren't the other values remembered as well?
