Import/Export should always be on context menu of Packages view (or never)

Build 20020521 The Packages view does only include Import when a container is selected. It only includes Export when a container or file is selected. When the selection is empty, neither appear. The Navigator always includes Import/Export on the context menu. Filtering these action based on the selection makes too many assumptions about the kinds of available importers / exporters. For example, the importers for external projects and binary projects ignore the selection. Therefore, I currently cannot import binary projects via the packages view when my workspace is empty. Either these actions should always be included (and enabled), or always excluded.
