[content assist] "Guess argument name" feature picks out-of-scope variables

public void method1() { MyType child = new MyType(); if (someCondition) { MyType parent = child.getParent(); ... } method2<<CARET>> } public void method2(MyType type) { ... } If you have the option to "Guess filled method arguments" turned on and you invoke content assist where the caret is, it guesses "parent" as the first argument choice, even though it's out-of-scope and hence not valid.
