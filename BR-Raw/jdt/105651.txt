[quick fix] Create getter for unused field

Hi all, A nice to have would be 'quick fix' to automatiically generate a getter when a field is, currently unused. public class MyClass { private int field; // unused field } click on lightbulb, select "Generate getter" would result in public class MyClass { private int field; // warning gone public int getField() { return field; } } ----- *Thanks* all for the great work. Eclipse gets better and better. I have to use an old version (WSAD) at work and boy do I notice the difference!
