Last character of Property Compare is clipped.

I was comparing the loaded version of one of our plugin.properities files with one in the repository. The files are typed as binary. The first version of the file had one line: pluginName = Standard Widget Toolkit The second file had two lines: pluginName = Standard Widget Toolkit providerName = Eclipse.org When I select the files in the text comparison browser, I correctly see "one line changed to two lines". However, when I pick the two properties individually, in the Property Compare view, the last character of the file is clipped off. So, if I pick "pluginName" I see pluginName = Standard Widget Toolki displayed in the left pane, and if I pick "providerName" I see providerName = Eclipse.or displayed in the right pane.
