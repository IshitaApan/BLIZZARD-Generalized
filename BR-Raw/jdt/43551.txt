Background conflicts with syntax highlighting in Edit Template of code gneration [code generation]

I have set my syntax highlighting colors. They use white foreground and black background for comments. In Preferences Java Code Generation Code & Comments If I edit an comment entry, eg Types I can not see the comments as it is using the syntax highlighting setting of white foreground but does not use the syntax highlighted background (black) but uses a default background of white. So I get white on white. It needs to either use all syntax highlight colors including background or default colors or no colors.
