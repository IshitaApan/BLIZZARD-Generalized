Refactor - need two undos to completely undo method extraction [refactoring]

Build F2 If you use Refactor to extract a method, it requires two 'Undo' operations to undo the refactoring. The first Undo removes the call to the new method, and the second Undo removes the new method. Refactor->Extract Method is a single operation, so it should only require a single Undo.
