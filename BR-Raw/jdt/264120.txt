Remove LineBreakingReader

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #264118 +++ Looks like JDT may have the same problem PDE has... an unused LineBreakingReader. org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.LineBreakingReader I'm marking this as major as having an unused class ship with the SDK is always tragic. Although I may have missed a use of this class, I've had enough wine tonight.
