Improve "Show view" dialog

Created attachment 171464 Patch The current e4 "Show view" dialog was a added as a quick stop-gap solution and can not be compared with 3.x analog. The attached patch is based in 3.x code that had to be modified, in some places significantly so. The new e4 dialog assumes that views are parts with "View" tag set and use "categoryTag:<name>" tag to specify view's category, if any. Differences from the 3.x base: - we only show single level of categories This is probably not a problem - most existing categories are one level deep. - we don't filter activities Activities should be filtered by the compatibility layer? - internally we use category names, rather then category IDs We use tag categoryTag:<category_name>. It might be OK as long as it fits whatever translation strategy we'll pick up. - did not register with the context help At RCP level, there is no analog to the workbench help service at this time. The amount of code that had to be copied (~100K) and the extent of required modifications (~2 days to make it work) underscore the need to refactor workbench plugin to make its components such as dialogs and UI jobs available at RCP level. I'll open a separate bug about that, probably to be addressed after the initial release.
