[Encoding] Changing editor encoding causes Eclipse to freeze for a while

Here's my setup: - latest 3.0.1 build (M20040908) - large number of projects in my workspace (i.e. all of Eclipse loaded from the repository) - latest IBM VM and JXE support I changed the encoding on the Editors preference page and clicked OK. There's was a fairly long (probably in the order of a minute) delay where there was something going on but there was no progress indication. At first, Eclipse was totally frozen (i.e. I could not even move the mouse). The preferences dialog remained open with OK diabled but Cancel enabled. Once the mouse was movable again, there was a busy cursor when the mouse was over the workbench but not when the mouse was over the preferences dialog. Eventually the dialog closed and a build was launched. I don't know what changing the encoding involves but clearly there is some pretty intensive work that is happening inside a busy cursor. Either this should be done in a progress dialog or a background job.
