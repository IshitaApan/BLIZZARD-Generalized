[Preferences] WorkingCopyPreferences.remove(key) not working

20050509-2010 The implementation of WorkingCopyPreferences.remove(key) handles the remove as no-op when the temporarySettings don't contain a key (line 189). That's wrong, it should still store 'null' to mark that this value is removed, so when the working copy settings are applied to the original settings a remove will be performed. Could this be fixed for M7? This seems to be the cause for bug 94367. 	public void remove(String key) { 		checkRemoved(); 		if (key == null) 			throw new NullPointerException(); 		if (!temporarySettings.containsKey(key)) 			return; 		Object oldValue = temporarySettings.get(key); 		if (oldValue == null) 			return; 		temporarySettings.put(key, null); 		firePropertyChangeEvent(key, oldValue, null); 	}
