Dynamic menu contributions using CompoundContributionItems are not visible

We are currently having problems with CompoundContributionItems when our Jubula Juno M4 feature runs in 4.2 context (see bug 367076). We are intensively using dynamic menu contributions in the main toolbar as well as in view toolbars. The button for the dynamic menu itself gets shown but it has neither a dropdown arrow nor a dropdown menu. The following code works fine in 3.7.x The code for one of our CompoundContributionItems can be found at: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jubula/org.eclipse.jubula.core.git/tree/org.eclipse.jubula.client.ui.rcp/src/org/eclipse/jubula/client/ui/rcp/contributionitems/StartAutContributionItem.java#n39 And the dynamic declarative menu extension for the main toolbar is here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/jubula/org.eclipse.jubula.core.git/tree/org.eclipse.jubula.client.ui.rcp/plugin.xml#n1410
