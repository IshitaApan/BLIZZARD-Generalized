[Wizards]  Define constants for wizard ids of new.file, new.folder, and new.project

In perspective factories, plugins have to reference the New wizards with a string that is susceptible to change during API reorganizations. For example, in org.eclipse.ui.internal.ResourcePerspective: // Add "new wizards". layout.addNewWizardShortcut("org.eclipse.ui.wizards.new.folder");//$NON-NLS-1$ layout.addNewWizardShortcut("org.eclipse.ui.wizards.new.file");//$NON-NLS-1$ There are constants for most view id's, for example IPageLayout.ID_RES_NAV, but not for these. This request is to add constants for the new wizard ids in the appropriate location. In addition to new.folder and new.file above, you also need a constant for new.project. There may be others but those are the only ones I found in a search.
