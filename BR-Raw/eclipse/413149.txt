[DI] InjectorImpl.findExtendedSupplier does not use correct PrimaryObjectSupplier

InjectorImpl.findExtendedSupplier uses its defaultSupplier to inject values into the ExtendedObjectSupplier. It is possible that defaultSupplier is NULL, in which case no injection happens. This is unnesessary, since a valid PrimaryObjectSupplier gets passed to findExtendedSupplier, which can be used for the injection in this case.
