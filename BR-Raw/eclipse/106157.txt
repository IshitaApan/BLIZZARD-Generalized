[Progress] [Dialogs] Can't close error dialog

I20050803-0800, KDE 3.4.1, GTK+ 2.6.7, X.org 6.8.2 Linux 2.6.12 If you generate a job error while the preference dialog is open, then the error dialog opens parented to the workbench window. On kwin, this means the error dialog is on top, but you can only interact with the preference dialog. You must close the preference dialog before interacting with the job dialog. My favourite way to do this at the moment is to throw a NPE in the PatternFilter.
