[IDE] [RCP] Use of Project Explorer in RCP requires internal IDE class WorkbenchAdapterBuilder

The magic incantation to get an RCP application working with resources and the CommonNavigator (or ResourceNavigator) is to call: WorkbenchAdapterBuilder.registerAdapters() However, this is an internal IDE class. If you don't call it, the CNF will fail in hard to diagnose ways (because there is no UndoRedo handler for example. In my conversations with Paul he is saying that the point of the IDE plugin is to be essentially the UI for resources and nothing more, that all of the "more" stuff is being moved to ui.ide.application. So if that's the case, then we probably just need to move this method to the API and prominently document it's requirement with the CNF/ResourceNavigator. And keep working on moving non-resource stuff out of the ui.ide plugin. And recommend that if you want to use the CNF (with resources) that you need: ui.navigator ui.navigator.resources core.resources ui.ide Alternatively, we can move the classes that are in ui.internal.ide.model to perhaps ui.navigator.resources. And then remove the dependency on ui.ide. I remain confused as to why there are two different plugins required to address the UI requirements for the CNF + resources, ui.navigator.resources and ui.ide. (I understand this might be some kind of legacy requirement).
