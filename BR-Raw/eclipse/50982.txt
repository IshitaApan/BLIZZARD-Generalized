Progress Floating window too small with big fonts

I20040128 The progress popup is too small when using large system font settings (125% of normal). For example, the job "Building workspace" does not fit (I see "Building wor..ce"). It may be fine for the window to have fixed width, but perhaps make it proportional to font size? (using Dialog.convertWidthInCharsToPixels, etc). I suspect this extra semi-colon in ProgressFloatingWindow.adjustSize might be to blame: if (size.x > maxSize) 	; size.x = maxSize;
