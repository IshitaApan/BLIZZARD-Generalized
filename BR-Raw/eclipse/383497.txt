"Build Project" key binding no longer works in 4.2 / juno

Build Identifier: 20120606-2254 I have a custom key binding for "Build Project" set in eclipse; it is set for "In Windows". In 4.2, it only seems to work if the current window is the project browser, AND I have a file in the project selected. In 3.7, it would work if I was in a text editor for a file in the project, and pressed my hotkey - now, this no longer works. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new workspace 2. Create a C++ project, Makefile project, Hello World (or likey other project type, it failed when I tried a java perspective as well) 3. From Windows >> Preferences >> General >> Keys, set a binding for "Build Project" to whatever you want (I usually have it set to "Ctrl B", and unbind build all, but all other keybindings I tried also failed). 4. open up the .cpp in the text editor 5. With the text editor still in focus, press your "Build Project" hotkey 6. ...nothing happens
