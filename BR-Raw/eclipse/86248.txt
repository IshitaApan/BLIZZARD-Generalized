[Commands] request: ctrl+pageup/down action doesn't have item in preferences/keys

hi, in 3.0.1 the behaviour of ctrl+pageup/down is much better and quickier inc comparison to ctrl/shift/+f6 i want the same behaviour as ctrl+pageup triggers to be mapped on F1/F2 as some extension to firefox does it, but it is not possible to remap it, cos there is no such item in preferences/keys anywhere (i did go through all of them watchig for ctrl+pageup -> no success :( )
