Make model loading plugable

Today our EMF usage is structured in a way that we can only load a model from XMI and inherit from EObjectImpl. This makes it impossible to leverage other EMF-Technologies (e.g. CDO). We should think about how we can restructure our code base to have possibility to support different model-storage technologies and different EObject-Implementations.
