[Field Assist] - API - Field Decoration alignment issues are different for cell editors

For background, see bug #124520. This bug discusses the need to reserve space for decorations so that decorated fields in a dialog will line up, and so that the reserved space for decorations can be queried and used by clients to line up non-decorated fields. This approach works nicely for dialogs, but not for cell editors. When using decorated fields in cell editors, the intent is to make the decoration as small as possible, and there is no need to reserve any additional space for alignment purposes. DecoratedField needs API whereby clients can specify whether to consider only that field's decorations sizes for layout or whether it should consider the maximum/reserved space as it does now.
