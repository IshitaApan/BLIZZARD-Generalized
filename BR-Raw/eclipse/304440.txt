[UX] Common search bar in the workbench

There have been numerous discussions regarding the desire to have a "common search box" in the eclipse workbench. There are a number of bugs surrounding the implementation of said box, but I don't think we have a bug anywhere that captures what kind of search should be supported in the workbench. - are we saying there should be a common search bar? - does it have selectable search engines a la firefox search bar? - where does it live visually? (in the trim? in the title bar on win7/cocoa? etc....) and most importantly: What does a common search box do in Eclipse? - several people have said this search box should support Ctrl-3 "quick access" style navigation. So that you could always type the name of any command/dialog/part you were looking for and quickly find it. This seems to be a favorite of Eclipse developers - Surely there is a bug asking for firefox-style text find/replace in the eclipse editors. Do we have such a bug? Do we think this would be implemented with a common search bar (or this is more of an editor thing?) - Are there existing platform search bugs where a common search bar has already been discussed? - Bug 69200 talks about common search for lists and trees. One might imagine a search box operating on the active part. - What is the relationship (if any) between this common search bar and the existing search extension points? Would it be useful/possible to present the existing searches in this search bar somehow? How would the user specify the search parameters besides text that are currently shown in the dialog? Maybe only those searches for which there are reasonable defaults should live in this bar. - Is there an extension point by which plug-ins can contribute their own kind of "simple search" and is this related at all to the existing search extension points? Please mark any relevant bugs that should be considered as blocking bugs so we can understand the various requirements.
