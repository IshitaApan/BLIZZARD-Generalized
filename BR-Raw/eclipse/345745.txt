[Compatibility] Editors occasionally fail to persist state (org.eclipse.ui.internal.emptyEditorTab)

I've noticed on occasion when restarting that all of the editors in one perspective are not recovered and instead show an "org.eclipse.ui.internal.emptyEditorTab" editor. I usually have each perspective configured to open in a separate window, and usually develop with two perspectives open, a Java Browsing perspective and a Debug perspective. To my recollection, when this problem has occurred, it has occurred in the Java Browsing perspective. The problem is unfortunately sporadic: it works sometimes, and doesn't others. The problem occurs during the persisting as the editor references in the deltas.xml are missing their persistedState map. There is nothing in the log indicating an error other than a stack trace due to bug 338221 â€” perhaps the model is being persisted twice but the state is different on the second time?
