Enable API tools for the e4.ui bundles

With all of the new API work happening for M6 and M7 we should enable API tools to make sure the API we are creating is correct - i.e. properly tagged, not leaking internal types, etc. I enabled the tooling in my workspace for only the *.e4.ui.* bundles and there are 51 API errors, 9 of which are the incorrect use of API tools javadoc tags. http://wiki.eclipse.org/ApiTools_Architecture#API_Javadoc_Tags
