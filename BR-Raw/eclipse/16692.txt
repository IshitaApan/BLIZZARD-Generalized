Editor Action Bars not updating properly

20020519 build 1. Go to the resources view. In Navigator pane do the following (in this order): a. double click on a *.class file b. double click on a *.java file c. double click on a *.java file d. double click on a *.class file. 2. The file in Step d has focus. Move the mouse over the tab for the file in Step a. Close the file by clicking the "X". At this point the file in Step b (a *.java file) will have focus, but the editor action bars indicate that a *.class file has focus. Note that if in Step 4, you close the file that has focus (i.e., the file in Step d) the editor action bars are updated properly.
