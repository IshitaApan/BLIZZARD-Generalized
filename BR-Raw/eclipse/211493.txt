[Markers] [Markers] New Markers view slows down traversal in Package Explorer

I20071127-0800 Traversing over elements in the Package Explorer via Arrow_Down key is slowed down by the new Markers view. Steps: - select org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user (from CVS) - press Arrow_Right - press and hold Arrow_Down => selection moves slowly, gets faster after folders with many files have been passed I quickly profiled this and found that a lot of time is burned in org.eclipse.ui.internal.provisional.views.markers.CachedMarkerBuilder$1.run(IProgressMonitor) This is probably because ExtendedMarkersView.createPartControl(Composite) contains: 		ISelectionListener listener = getPageSelectionListener(); 		getSite().getPage().addSelectionListener(listener); 		listener.selectionChanged(getSite().getPage().getActivePart(), 				getSite().getPage().getSelection()); 1. => should not leak the listener when the view is disposed 2. => should not update when the Markers view is not visible 3. => should not use addSelectionListener() but addPostSelectionListener()
