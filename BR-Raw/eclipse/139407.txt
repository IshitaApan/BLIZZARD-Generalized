[DataBinding] TestMasterDetail not updating when changing Person State

When running org.eclipse.jface.examples.databinding/src/org.eclipse.jface.examples.databinding.nestedselection.TestMasterDetail and editing a Person's State the master table isn't updated when the State's value changes. The reason for this is that the Person object isn't notifying listeners of changes.
