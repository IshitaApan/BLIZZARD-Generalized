[Markers] Group sorting needs criterea other than lexical value

20060117 Lexicial sorting is not good enough for the severity group as we need to sort errors before warnings and the translation of the word error may not appear lexically before warnings. The sorting of groups needs to be the same as the sort order of thier elements. This turns out to be an issue for groups contributed via attributes as well. My suggestion is that allow the group to sort either by attribute value or by name (the default) so that sort order can be supplied by the group contributor. I am including the JDT team as they may want to use this support to determine sort ordering within thier groups.
