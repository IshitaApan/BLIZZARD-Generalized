[Viewers] JFace TreeViewer collapses node when sibbling removed

3.2 1. Use the Eclipse Wizard to produce a plugin with a tree viewer view. 2. Paste the modified SampleView.java - this looks like the left part of the attached screenshot 3. Click on the top node Parent1 and type - 4. TreeViewer.remove is called to remove Parent 1. TreeViewer.refresh is called - this looks like the right part of the attached screenshot Wrong: node Parent 4 is now collapsed. Expectation Parent 4 is still expanded. Is there any workaround? Am I misusing your API? Note. The snippet is almost identical to the code generated by PDE for plugin / view / Tree Viewer. Here is the extra code in createPartControl: 		viewer.getTree().addKeyListener(new KeyListener() { 		 			public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) { 				// TODO Auto-generated method stub 		 			} 		 			public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) { 				if (e.character == '-') { 					TreeParent parent = (TreeParent) ((IStructuredSelection)viewer.getSelection()).toArray()[0]; 					parent.getParent().removeChild(parent); 					viewer.refresh(); 				} 				if (e.character == '+') { 					TreeParent parent = (TreeParent) ((IStructuredSelection)viewer.getSelection()).toArray()[0]; 					parent.addChild(new TreeParent(new Date().toString())); 				} 					 			} 		 		});
