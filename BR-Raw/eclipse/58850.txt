OutOfMemory Errors must not be silent

It is possible for an outof memory expection to occurr but the user has to be made aware that this occurred. I had a case where a build failed due to an out of memory exception and the only indication I had was a problem was added to the problems view. Unfortunately because the build failed there were many other problems in the view.
