[DnD] DND should reorder or detach perspectives.

As suggested by mvm the perspectivebar should reorder perspective buttons on drag and drop over another perspective button, similar to what ViewStacks do with views. Additionally, if you drag a perspective button outside of the main eclipse window (or initiate by some other method of detachment), it would be useful if that perspective would spawn in a new WorkbenchWindow with the same state it would have had you restored it normally.
