[Contributions] Can't distinguish structured selection from text selection

The JDT UI has a couple of global actions (Refactor menu) that work on both a strucutured selection and a text selection. Currently it is not possible to define enablement criterias depending on the type of the selection. I would like to write down something like this: <enablement> <if selection_class= "....ITextSelection"> <enablesFor value="1"/> </endif> <if selection_class= "...IStructuredSelection"> <enablesFor value="1"/> <objectClass name="org.eclipse.jdt.core.IMethod"/> </endif> </enablement> Any idea how to do that ?
