[Markers] Add icon support for marker groupings

3.3 M3 - after a complete rebuild, I wanted to see if there were any errors - switched to the Problems view, which I had grouping by Java Problem Type - it showed several categories (all collapsed) - I couldn't tell at a glance if these represented errors or warnings -- I had to go and read the heading titles and expand a few to be comfortable that there weren't any errors - then I remembered that the counts are shown in the content description, and this showed 0 errors It would be nice if I could tell at a glance (visually, not just textually) what the severities are. Currently the icon used for category headings is a generic "tree of nodes" graphic. Could we associate a severity with a category and show the corresponding icon instead? Since JDT allows severities to be customized, we'd probably need to allow these to be specified programmatically, not just declaratively. Or perhaps the view could calculate the max severity in each category and show that.
