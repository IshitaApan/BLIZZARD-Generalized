[DataBinding] WizardPageSupport does not report exceptions thrown in bindings

Created attachment 75607 Possible (untested) changes Build ID: HEAD Steps To Reproduce: I've been using WizardPageSupport quite extensively and it doesn't check that a particular ValidationStatus has an exception associated with it. The user gets a message saying "An error occurred while setting the value.", but there is no indication that an exception has been thrown. These Exception usually originate from observable.setValue calls that have gone wrong which UpdateValueStrategy#doSet catches and wraps them in a error ValidationStatus. WizardPageSupport is locked down so it can't be extended to handle proper reporting of error. More information: Is there any reason as to why WizardPageSupport is locked down? Not even the constructor is accessible (even though the class is not final). Any chance of either adding logging of exceptions or better yet, allow WizardPageSupport to be extended? I've attached an untested WizardPageSupport that: * Allows the constructor to be used (public) * Uses AggregateValidationStatus.MERGED instead of AggregateValidationStatus.MAX_SEVERITY so all exceptions in all statuses can be handled. * Adds a check to handleStatusChanged to see if exception handling is necessary * Adds an overridable method to handle exception reporting. As currentStatus can now be a regular IStatus or a MultiStatus, the handleStatusException need to check for each and handle the statuses differently. This could be done better.
