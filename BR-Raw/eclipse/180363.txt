[LinkedResources] No way to create a linked resource based on a variable

Eclipse 3.3M6 1. In shell: mkdir /tmp/test 2. In Eclipse define a path variable TMP pointing to /tmp under Preferences/Workspace/Linked Resources 3. Select a project, click New Folder, Advanced. Check Link to folder in the file system. Type TMP/test, click Finish. The folder gets added to .project file as: <link> <name>test</name> <type>2</type> <location>/tmp/test</location> </link> instead of expected: <link> <name>test</name> <type>2</type> <locationURI>TMP/test</locationURI> </link> This is a regression from Eclipse 3.2.
