The Regular Expression Resource Filter must gracefully handle invalid patterns

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #304276 +++ > The Regular Expression Resource Filter must gracefully handle invalid > patterns instead of causing the refresh local to fail with an exception such as: The result of adding an invalid regular expression is a Message: "Internal Error" written to the error log, and there is no UI feedback that the regular expression is invalid. java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException: Dangling meta character '*' near index 0 *.working ^ at java.util.regex.Pattern.error(Pattern.java:1713) at java.util.regex.Pattern.sequence(Pattern.java:1878) at java.util.regex.Pattern.expr(Pattern.java:1752) at java.util.regex.Pattern.compile(Pattern.java:1460) This doesn't help the user as: - the error is labelled as internal, when it's a user error - the Error Log View may not be part of the perspective; many users don't think to look in here when something goes wrong. - the Platform RCP distribution doesn't contain the ErrorLog View by default, so tools products which aren't shipped on top of the SDK may not have an easy means of discovering what went wrong.
