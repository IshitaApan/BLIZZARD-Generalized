[Commands] registry: ISourceProvider for selection and context change is not implemented

According to the Help file for the org.eclipse.ui.handlers extension point, "The workbench provides some variables that these expressions can rely on. The variables supported are: the active contexts, the active editor, the active part and the current selection." I created an extension that is using the selection expression. 		<activeWhen> 		 <with variable="selection"> 		 <count value="1" /> 		 		 </with> 		 </activeWhen> I noticed that the expression is not evaluated when global selection changes. Looking through the code I did not find any ISourceProvider implementations for the selection or context. In the first place, I was able to get the activeWhen expression to get evaluated only after applying the fix suggested in the bug #102626. It looks like the Handler activation is implemented only half way and never tested.
