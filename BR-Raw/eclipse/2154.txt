Drag and Drop files does not check 'read-only' (1GE8MAV)

If you drag and drop a read-only files, you are not prompted to confirm the move. If you move the read-only file using the popup menu, you get an error (see: 1GE8LT7: ITPUI:WIN - Internal Error: moving read-only files) 1) create a new project 2) in the Navigator, add a file in the root directory 3) create a new directory 4) make the file read-only (right click on file, click properties, Info, click "Read Only", click OK) 5) drag and drop the file to another directory The file is moved without prompting the user. The workbench should ALWAYS verify that the user really wants to move the read-only file. NOTES: JEL (24/05/2001 12:16:06 PM) 	Related PR's: 		1GE8MI1: ITPUI:ALL - What is "read-only" property for?
