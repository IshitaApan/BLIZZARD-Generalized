[Markers] Default task priority sorting shouldn't be ascending

If you start the Eclipse Workbench it always sorts the tasks in the task tab in this way: Completed - Ascending Priority - Ascending Description - Ascending Resource - Ascending This is the default setting in Eclipse 3.2.1. and is (in my opinion) always active if you restart Eclipse (whatever you've set before the last exit - maybe this is another bug too). I think, it would be better if the priority is descending sorted. So tasks with a high priority are more important than tasks with a lower prio... That makes more sense...
