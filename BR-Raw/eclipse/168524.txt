[WorkbenchParts] On restart partActivated (and partVisible) called before widgets are visible

Use I20061219-0800 or newer to reproduce but problem also in earlier builds. I added code to restore the editor selection upon restart (see bug 124615). This works for all (also if >1 window) but the first restored editor: the selection is not correctly revealed and the the scroll bar thumbs aren't correct. There are two reasons that cause this: one is SWT bug 168429 and the other one is this one: When the very first editor is restored partActived(...) and if using IPartListener2 also partVisible(...) are called before the part's widgets are actually visible i.e. editor's StyledText.isVisble() returns false. This is not expected. Clicking on other editor tabs afterwards shows the correct behavior. See also bug 154112 which might be related but not that this bug only appears for the very first visible editor and works when activating other not yet realized editors.
