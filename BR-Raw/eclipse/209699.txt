[WorkbenchParts] org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPartConstants should clarify its restrictions

It looks like this interface should not be implemented by the client, but this is not explicitly stated in the doc of the interface. The constant PROP_PREFERRED_SIZE has been added since 3.3.0 and this would be a breakage if this interface can be implemented. The components.xml located in the plugin org.eclipse.ui doesn't have the implements="false" restriction on this type.
