[Commands] This warning is really suspicious

From 200404270800 compiler logs, I think this warning is really suspicious. I believe it is hiding a bug. There is no local variables called contextBindingDefinitions. ---------- 1. WARNING in /builds/I/src/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/commands/PreferenceCommandRegistry.java (at line 111) 	this.contextBindingDefinitions = 						contextBindingDefinitions; 	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The assignment to variable contextBindingDefinitions has no effect ---------- 1 problem (1 warning)
