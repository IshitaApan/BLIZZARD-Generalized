[context] Add dependency injection context -> user object

Created attachment 124609 Proposed patch - service injection The proposed patch adds a new static method: ContextInjectionFactory#inject(Object object, IEclipseContext context) That injects elements from the context into a Java object. The field and method injection is used with the following default rules For the service named "xyz" in the context: - field "eclipseXyz" or "eclipsexyz" with appropriate types will be set - method "setXyz" or "setxyz" will be called When value of "xyz" changes in the context, the corresponding field of the user object will be set to the new value, and set...() methods will be called with new values. For details, see Javadoc on IJavaInjection. Also adds convenience interface IEclipseContextAware.
