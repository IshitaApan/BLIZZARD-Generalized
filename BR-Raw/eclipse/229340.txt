In the Plug-in Content page (2nd page), select the Yes radio button under the Rich Client Application group and click Next 5.Under the Templates page, select Hello RCP 6.Note: on the right-hand-side of the UI, under Extension Used, the second extendion name is not layout correctly in its bullet form. See attached screenshot. More information: When creating a PDE project, if the extension name on the template's page is somewhat long, the list of extension names under the "Extensions Use" gets distored - the bullets are not layout correnctly, the long extension names are not completly vissible since there is no vertical scrollbar.
