[KeyBindings] Key indication does not work if more than 1 window

I20030910 1. start empty workbench 2. switch to Emacs mode 3. open n new windows Observe: pressing "Esc" is only indicated in status line of the last opened window and does not work for all other n-1 windows. I normally work with two windows: the first one shows the Java perspective and the second my Debug perspective. As a consequence I never see when Esc is pressed while writing code.
