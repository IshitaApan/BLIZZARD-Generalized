[Dialogs] TitleAreaDialog status line blinks when newMessage == currentMessage

Build id: 200211051258 The current implementation for TitleAreaDialog#showMessage(String,int) method has a guard against updates to the message with the same content (to avoid needlessly blinking). The problem is that after that the message may be concatenated with a space character: ==================== //If there is an image then add in a space to the message //for layout purposes if(newImage != null) message = " " + message; //$NON-NLS-1$ ==================== So the guard will fail in the next call even if the same string is provided by the client.
