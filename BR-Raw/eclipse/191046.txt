[Min/Max] View does not open 2nd time when editor max'd

3.3 RC3 I'm not sure how to reproduce this bug. I've seen two odd behaviours: 1. I had opened a test workspace with the editor area maximized. I did Cntrl-3 to open the Plug-ins view. The view opened but the editor was no longer maximized and the plugins view was showing open in its own stack. It should've opened as a fast view. Oddly, it was a vertical view to the right of the editor (vs. the usual default position of horizontal/bottom), but this might be a red herring as I may have moved the placeholder stack there in a previous session, can't be sure. Closing the view left the perspective in the odd state of having the editor area not maximized but all other stacks minimized (so you can hit max/restore on the editor and nothing appears to happen). 2. In trying to reproduce this, I ended up in some state whereby Cntrl-3 opening the plugins view resulting in nothing ... no view, nothing in log. I probably had the view opened previously (in another session) but not since I had restarted that workbench. I will continue to try to find the steps for this.
