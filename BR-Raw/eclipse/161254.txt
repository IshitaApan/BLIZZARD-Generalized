[IDE][WorkbenchLauncher] workspace MRU should be shown in the menu

3.3M2 I've been using the Switch Workspaces option a LOT lately and I've been finding it quite frustrating. I usually only switch between two workspaces and to do this requires a trip to the File menu, then navigating a combo in a dialog, and finally hitting OK. It'd be nice if the MRU list contained in dialog combo was also shown as children of the Switch Workspaces menu item. I have a patch that accomplishes this if you're interested.
