[IDE] Allow to apply file attribute changes recursively

Build Identifier: Version: 3.6.1.r361_v20100909-9gF78GrkFqw7GrsZnvz0JWNTeb6fue6896L - Build id: M20100909-0800 An RDz user creates a project and a folder with a couple of members. He sets the folder properties to read only. However, the members do not inherit the read only property. Also new members may be added to the folder. Note that under Windows, if a folder is set to read only, the user is given the option to apply read only to the members. I am not sure if this is a bug or enhancement. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an RDz project 2. Create a folder 3. Put 1 or 2 members in the folder. 4. Set the folder properties to read only and apply. 5. Check the members' properties and they are not read only. 6. Try Refresh, reducing and expanding the project and folder, bringing RDz down and back up, but nothing changes.
