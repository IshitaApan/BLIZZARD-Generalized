JFace's default collator not using ICU when running IDE

3.3.2 build A while back we decided to use ICU for the IDE stack, but allow JFace and RCP apps to opt-in rather than having a hardwired requirement on ICU (which is large). See bug 154884 for the history. This was to be accomplished by having JFace sorters/comparators get their default comparator from Policy.getComparator(), which would be initialized to the appropriate Collator from ICU during the IDE's initialization. In 3.3.2, IDEWorkbenchAdvisor's initialize method does: Policy.setComparator(Collator.getInstance()); but it's using java.text's Collator, not ICU's. I'm not sure if this was never done as intended in 3.2, or if this change somehow got lost (e.g. in the refactoring of ide.application), but it would appear that, due to this, viewers in the IDE are not getting ICU "for free" as originally intended. Clients may, of course, use: new ViewerComparator(com.ibm.icu.text.Collator.getInstance()) but the intent was that: new ViewerComparator() would have the same effect when running on top of the IDE.
