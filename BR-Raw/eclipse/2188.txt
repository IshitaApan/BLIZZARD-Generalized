OLE editor does not re-paint its toolbar until editor is activated. (1GEAE3P)

1) create a doc file. 	2) create a bmp file. 	if you switch bettween editors if works file 	but if you go to the navigator and switch the 	selected file the content of the file is re-painted in the 	editor but the toolbars, status bar,etc are not. NOTES: 	EJP (5/25/01 10:55:17 AM) 		I understand it is a bit related to our model, ie, when the editor 		is not activated the action are not showed in the toolbar but 		in this case it is a local tool bar and it does not have a nice 		visual efect.
