[Commands] errors: Incomplete and confusing warning

Build: I-20050315 So I create an RCP mail template plugin project. when I launch a runtime app, I see the following warning in my log: >Error 2005-03-15 17:58:26.510 Warnings while parsing the commands from >the 'org.eclipse.ui.commands' and 'org.eclipse.ui.actionDefinitions' >extension points. This message is given the severity of an error; yet the message says 'Warnings' This log entry is then followed by a multistatus. The parent of the multistatus has the same text as the error above, but this time it has a severity of INFO. This leads me to believe that the error one above should not have been logged at all. Inside the multistatus, I have two entries of the form: >Info 2005-03-15 17:58:26.510 Commands should really have a category, >not '': 'com.example.xyz', 'com.example.xyz.openMessage'. After the word category, I have no idea what the text is trying to say. It seems that a few words have been left out. I suppose it's complaining about the following markup: <command name="Open Message Dialog" description="Open a message dialog" id="com.example.xyz.openMessage"> </command> but I don't understand what I should be doing to fix the problem.
