[Compatibility] Folder layout with only placeholders gets rendered

Created attachment 194296 Screenshot depicting the problem in question. I've seen this problem even on 3.x too actually (though I forgot how to reproduce the problem). I'm going to guess this perspective doesn't have problems on 3.x though or else they would've found out about it by now...I think.
