[Jobs] Unprintable characters in decorator progress message

I20040212 (2000) I am seeing unprintable characters and internal resource string representations like "L/P1/abc.txt" in the decorator job subtask messages in the progress view. The strings with the prefix L are generated by calling IResource.toString(), which isn't really appropriate for showing to the user. IResource.getFullPath().toString() should be displayed instead. I suspect the unprintable characters are line feeds. I will attach a screen cap.
