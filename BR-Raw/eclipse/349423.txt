[Compatibility] 'Source' and 'Refactor' menus disappear after installing Photran

After installing Photran from Indigo and restarting, the 'Source' and 'Refactor' menus no longer show up when the 'Package Explorer' is the active part. If I select something in the view the 'Refactor' menu shows up but the 'Source' menu does not.
