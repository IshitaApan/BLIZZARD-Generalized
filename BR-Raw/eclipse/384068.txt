Unexpected partVisible and partBroughtToTop events lead to wrong History view updating in Link with... mode

Broken in 4.2, works fine in 3.8. Bad selection updates lead to wrong Git History view updating in Link with... mode. Steps: - have EGit 2.0 installed and a repo checked out - open an editor for a file from Git - open History view and enable "Link with Editor and Selection" and "Show all changes of selected resource and its children - in the Git Repositories view, select a repo => good: History view input changes to repo - click into the table in the History view to select another commit => bad: History view input changes to the editor input. Real severity is blocker, since this is enough to stop me from using 4.2 for real development.
