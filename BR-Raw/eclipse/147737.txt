[Wizards] Delete dead multi step wizard code

Build: Eclipse 3.2 In Eclipse 2.0 there was a failed attempt to introduce a new kind of multi-step wizard as part of the capabilities proposal: http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-ui-home/capabilities-proposal/proposal.html This was eventually abandonned, but some of the code remains in HEAD. This dead code causes unnecessary work for committers - I see from the history of these classes that many bug fixes have been applied to them such as support for ICU4J and EFS, when it is actually dead code. Also, it creates confusion because there is duplicate code - NewProjectWizard duplicates much of the actively used BasicNewProjectResourceWizard, and WizardNewProjectNameAndLocationPage duplicates functionality in WizardNewProjectCreationPage. In some cases there have been bugs fixed in the live wizard code that has not been applied to these duplicates. Overall, I think it's better for the health and maintainability of the active code if we delete all these dead classes.
