Request preference to always open intro on startup

This is related to Bug 241885. We have a request to be able to always show intro on startup, this would be controlled by a checkbox. Currently there is a preference SHOW_INTRO in org.eclipse.ui.workbench but it gets set to false when intro is opened which creates the current behavior where Intro shows the first time Eclipse is launched. This is the behavior we want for the Eclipse SDK but we should also allow products to specify that intro should always be opened on startup and possibly also have a checkbox to turn it off. This has been requested more than once and it seems like something that we should implement. There are several ways in which we could create this behavior: 1. Add a preference ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO to org.eclipse.ui.intro which would cause the SHOW_INTRO flag to get set back to true if ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO was true. 2. Create an intro extension with a checkbox to turn on and off the ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO behavior and save the value of the checkbox in metadata. 3. Add the ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO preference to org.eclipse.ui.workbench. The downside to the first approach is that we have two closely related preferences, one in org.eclipse.ui.workbench and one in org.eclipse.ui.intro. We will have to explain that if SHOW_INTRO is false and ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO is true intro will not be shown. The second approach links the ALWAYS_SHOW_INTRO behavior to the appearance of the checkbox on the intro page, there would be java code associated with the initialization of the checkbox which would set the SHOW_INTRO flag accordingly. This breaks down if not all intro pages would get the checkbox. The main downside to the third approach is that we again have two closely related preferences, but at least they live in the same place. As a side benefit it would make it easy for intro developers who create their own IntroPart implementation to always show intro.
