[Decorators] getLabelDecorator fails for lightweight decorators

build I20021206 The Team team is in the process of changing their decorator from heavyweight to lightweight. They got an NPE calling getLabelDecorator with the new id, since it assumes the decorator is heavyweight and is in the list of definitions. getLabelDecorator also returns ILabelDecorator instead of ILightweightLabelDecorator. Since this can't be changed due to backwards compatibility, we need to add a new method: ILightweightLabelDecorator getLightweightLabelDecorator(String decoratorId).
