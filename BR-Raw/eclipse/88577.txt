[Viewers] Deferred viewers in JFace have a dependency on Job

build I20050315 In order to enable standalone SWT+JFace apps, we want to keep the dependencies on org.eclipse.core.runtime minimal. This has always been the case, but there were some regressions in 3.0, which we're fixing up for 3.1. See bug 49497 for more details. The new support for deferred viewers introduces an unwanted dependency on the jobs mechanism. This support needs to be moved up to the Workbench level.
