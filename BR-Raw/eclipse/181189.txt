[EditorMgmt] Bring back 'Quick Switch Editor' on Ctrl+E (QuickAccess is now Ctrl+3)

M6 The new 'Quick Access' action might have its fans but IMO it isn't a good replacement for the old Quick Switch Editor. I suggest to keep Ctrl + E as Quick Switch Editor and experiment with the new 'Quick Access' on Ctrl + Shift + E Reasons why 'Quick Access' is problematic - Mixing view names, wizards name, simple action names and editor input names is mixing different things into one. You're lucky if the term that you are looking for is unique. But try to type 'New' to focus on an editor for New.java: All in all it seems to me like a UI blooper to mix all the various concepts in one. - Open preference page, open view, open editor is useful - Show actions is less useful: they depend on the selection
