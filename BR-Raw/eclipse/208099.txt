[Contributions] Toggling logical structure "Show As > Array" has no effect

I20071030 * Using the "Show As >" menu to selectively enable/disable logical structures for specific kinds of objects has no effect 90% of the time. The check mark will usually not toggle on the menu item either. Once and a while the action seems to stick. Strange.
