[Compatibility] IEvaluationService.requestEvaluation() does not call property tester as it used to

CDT provides a feature to allow to do reverse debugging (step backwards). When reverse debugging is possible, CDT makes visible 4 new buttons on the debug toolbar: "reverse step into", "reverse step over", "reverse resume", and "uncall" (reverse step return). This small howto shows screenshots of the buttons and how to enable them: http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#How_do_I_do_Reverse_Debugging.3F The problem is that when the 'toggle reverse debugging' is pressed, the buttons don't appear immediately with 4.2. In 3.8 we achieved the immediate visibility using: IEvaluationService exprService = (IEvaluationService) PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService(IEvaluationService.class); exprService.requestEvaluation("org.eclipse.cdt.debug.ui.isReverseDebuggingEnabled"); This is called in CDT's org.eclipse.cdt.debug.internal.ui.commands.ReverseToggleCommandHandler In turn, in 3.8, the IEvaluationService calls org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.internal.ui.actions.ReverseDebuggingPropertyTester right away. In 4.2, when I press the 'toggle reverse debugging' button, IEvaluationService.requestEvaluation() is being called, but it never gets to the CDT property tester anymore. If I can help get more info, please let me know.
