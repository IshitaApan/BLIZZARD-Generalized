[Workbench] [Doc] SelectionEnabler.SelectionClass should be internal

3.1 M5 The nested class SelectionEnabler.SelectionClass is an implementation detail of SelectionEnabler. It was exposed as API in 3.0 without documentation. It should not be API. Need to make package visible, and document this change in the 3.1 migration guide.
