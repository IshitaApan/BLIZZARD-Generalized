[DataBinding] CComboUpdatableValue Doesn't Handle Text That Isn't in The List of Selected Items

The current implementation of CComboUpdatableValue will only allow setting text if the value is in the list of possible selection values. In reality the CCombo allows either a manually entered value (which may not be in the list) or the selection of a value from the drop down list. I'll be submitting a patch for this shortly.
