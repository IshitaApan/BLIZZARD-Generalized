[Viewers] Add tooltip support for DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider

Build ID: I20080530-1730 Steps To Reproduce: DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider has support for IFontProvider and IColorProvider but not for tooltip methods defined in CellLabelProvider I can delegate it from DelegatingStyledCellLabelProvider to IStyledLabelProvider by myself, but it should be nice to have it in standard api...
