Editors not closed properly when reusing editors with multiple workbooks

Number of editors to reuse should be independent of the number of editor workbooks but seems that if the number is 4 and you have 2 editors workbook, you may end up with 8 editors. When the editor to be reused is in another workbook, the active workbook is changed. I think that making sure the number of opened editors before closing is fixed it will make it more predictable.
