[Actions] hideActionSet API not working

From the newsgroup: > I'm writing a new perspective, and there are some action sets that I don't > really want visible the first time that the perspective is loaded, without > having to use the "Customize Perspective" dialog.

Verified that hideActionSet(String) does not work as expected. I tried to hide the External Tools action set, but visible action sets are always considered as "alwaysOn" and hideActionSet does not hide "alwaysOn" action sets. There needs to be a programmatic way to hideActionSets. Also see [Bug 36968] which talks about associating specific action sets to perspectives.
