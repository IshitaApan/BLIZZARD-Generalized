[Preferences] Some preferences aren't persisted on shutdown

I200409200800 (JXE), GTK+ 2.4.9, KDE 3.3, Linux 2.6.8.1 Some preferences are not persisted on shutdown. Confirmed on all platforms: text preferences. Possibly also show intro view, prompt on exit, etc. Setting this as critical, as I'm not sure if this data is lost or simply ignored. If it is just ignored, then downgrade to major.
