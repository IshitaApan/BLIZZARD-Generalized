[Workbench] 'Open Referenced Projects' dialog prompt ignores 'esc' key

Created attachment 84237 Patch to interpret the 'esc' key as cancelling the entire operation. Reproduced by me on I20071127-0800 and Nick on 3.4M3. 1. Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > 'Open referenced projects when a project is opened' > Prompt 2. Have two closed projects in your workspace. 3. Double-click on one of them in the 'Package Explorer' (or just use the context menu for 'Open Project'). 4. A dialog appears. 5. Hit the 'esc' key to dismiss it. 6. The project opens anyway. :( When you press 'Cancel', the whole open operation gets cancelled. But maybe the user just pressed the 'Esc' key to dismiss that one dialog? So, is the key supposed to be a 'No' or is the key supposed to be a 'Cancel'?
