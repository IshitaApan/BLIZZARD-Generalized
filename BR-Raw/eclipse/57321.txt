Remaining build UI items

This is a meta-bug to track the remaining issues with the new project build commands. 1) Confusion about disabled build commands when autobuild is turned on. Bug 57214 and bug 55794. Consider removing them entirely when autobuild is on. This is inconsistent with usual menu practice, but the argument is that commands are typically disabled when not applicable for a particular selection. In the case of the build commands, they are not applicable as long as the autobuild preference is turned on. In some (common) cases, this means they are disabled forever. 2) Confusion about how full rebuild is triggered (bug 55567). Suggestion is to refine the clean dialog message when autobuild is on. (see bug 55567 comment 7). Possibly also rename the action to "Build Clean" or "Clean Build". 3) Too much work to do a full rebuild. Once took two clicks, now takes five. (Not sure if there is a bug number). One solution is to add a "Build immediately" check box to the clean dialog when autobuild is turned off. If this was enabled by default, it would reduce clicks to three. 4) Clean happens in UI thread (bug 55741). Patch attached to that bug. 5) Clean dialog selection doesn't honor editor input-based selection (bug 56826). 6) Key bindings for "build clean" and "build working set" not working consistently.
