[ActivityMgmt] Capabilities returning to default enabled state after user disabled capability

Build ID: I20070418-1012 I used a brand new workspace to reproduce this. Steps To Reproduce: 1. Launch eclipse, go to the capabilities preference page and turn off one of the enable capabilities (I tested using the Team capability). 2. Press the "OK" button (don't press apply first). If you open up the org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs file you will see "UIActivities.org.eclipse.team.cvs=false". 3. Shutdown eclipse and restart. Go to the capabilities preference page and re-enable the activity you disabled (for this test, enable the team capabilitiy). 4. Press the "OK" button (don't press apply first). If you open up the org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs file you will see "UIActivities.org.eclipse.team.cvs=true". 5. Shutdown eclipse and restart. Go to the capabilities preference page and disable the activity you disabled (for this test, enable the team capabilitiy). 6. Press the "OK" button (don't press apply first). If you open up the org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs file you will not see an entry for "UIActivities.org.eclipse.team.cvs" (or the org.eclipse.ui.workbench.prefs file does not exist at all). 7. Shutdown eclipse and restart. Go to the capabilities preference page and observe that the team capability is now enabled. But in steps 5 & 6 this capability was disable. Expected the state of the capability to always remain at the state the user set them to.
