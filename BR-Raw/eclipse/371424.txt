WorkbenchPage#getPerspectiveStack() gets called a lot when opening&closing views

During a cycle of { open view, close view} WorkbenchPage#getPerspectiveStack() gets called about 1,000 times. This method in turn calls EModelService#findElements() which takes some time to search the model. It does not seem that the value returned by getPerspectiveStack() can change during the execution, so I'll add a cache to hold the result of this method.
