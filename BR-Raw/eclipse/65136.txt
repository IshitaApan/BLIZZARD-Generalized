[RCP] [ViewMgmt] Multi-view instances not persisted properly across sessions

build I20040529-0105 - change the browser example to allow multiple browser views to be created, and configure the workbench to save its state between sessions - open 3 browser views on different URLs - shutdown/restart - the multi-instance views are not restored properly In the <views>/<view> element, it is not saving the secondaryId, but it should. In the <perspective>/<view> element, it is correctly saving the secondary id. In the <perspective>/<folder> element, the activePageID attribute does not include the secondary id, but it should. In the <perspective>/<folder>/<page> element, the content attribute does not include the secondary id, but it should. In the <perspective>/<presentation> element, the <part> children have only a numbered id. This probably comes from the stack presentation, and is likely OK, but needs to be checked (in my example, I was using simple numbers as the secondaryId).
