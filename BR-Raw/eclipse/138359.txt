[ProblemsView] Filters not restored on import

I have 2 problems view filters in my saved preferences. 1 is the default filter, changed to only work on the select item. 2 is a new filter, where the sev is Error. When created, it defaulted to "On working set" where the working set default was the Workspace Working set. I just created a new workspace in N20060425-0010, imported my preferences, and grabbed platform-ui from HEAD. None of the errors (for win32 and carbon) showed up, and when I checked my #2 filter, the working set has been changed to non-selected. PW
