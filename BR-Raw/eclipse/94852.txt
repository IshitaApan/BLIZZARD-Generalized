[ViewMgmt] (regression) Typing space should activate view menu button

Build id: I20050510-0010 Give focus to a view menu button. For example, in the Package Explorer view, give focus to the tree, and type shift+tab, shift+tab. The view menu (little down-pointing triangle) button should have focus (it looks a bit raised). When this button (or any button) has focus, screen readers will give a hint to their users that they can activate this button by pressing space. Space does nothing when pressed in this button. It should drop down the view menu. I realize that pressing Ctrl+F10 does drop down the menu, therefore typing space is not technically needed for accessibility, however it is really strange that here is a button (in a toolbar) that does nothing when "pressed" using the keyboard space key. For consistency, and to do the expected thing when used with a screen reader, we should allow space key to work here. (Note that all of our other toolbar buttons do activate when they have focus and space is pressed - including the very similar "Open Perspective" menu toolbar button).
