[ActivityMgmt] [QuickAccess] Disabled/filtered contributions are available in the Quick Access dialog

Build Identifier: 20100917-0705 It looks like the Quick Access dialog (Ctrl+3) does not bother (all) contributions which are otherwise disabled using the org.eclipse.ui.activities extension point. Tried with "Cheat Sheets" view part and the "General/Perspectives" preference page. The view correctly disappeared from the "Show View" dialog and the preferences page disappeared correctly from the Preferences dialog (General->Perspectives), but both could still to be found in the Quick Access dialog (opened by Ctrl+3). Even worse, the view could also be openened that way (the perspective page not). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Contribute to org.eclipse.ui.activities: <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.activities"> <activity description="Filtered items still appear in Quick Access" id="my.disabled.ones" name="Disabling some contributions"> </activity> <activityPatternBinding activityId="my.disabled.ones" isEqualityPattern="true" pattern="org.eclipse.ui.ide/org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Perspectives"> </activityPatternBinding> <activityPatternBinding activityId="my.disabled.ones" isEqualityPattern="true" pattern="org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets/org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.views.CheatSheetView"> </activityPatternBinding> </extension> 2. Launch as Eclipse Application using a launch config that includes the plugins org.eclipse.ui.workbench, org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets (plus required ones) 3. Open the Quick Access dialog by pressing Ctrl+3 4. Enter "Cheat" -> "Cheat Sheet - Help" view appears within the Views section and can be opened 5. Enter "Perspe" -> "Perspectives General" preference page appears in the Preferences section (though selecting it just opens the Preferences dialog, but not the page)
