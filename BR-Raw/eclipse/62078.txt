[Progress] Cancelled jobs need to have lowest priority

As we cannot rely on job checking cancel enough we should sort them to the bottom of the list so that they do not show up in the progress region unless they are the only job. Here is a scenario where this can happen: - clicked the sync button in the sync view - it started a sync - pressed Run in Background - did the same again - in the progress view, it showed two sync jobs, but only one was active - terminated the other one - it did not get cleared from the list - it also showed "Synchronizing: (0%) null" - while the other job continued to make progress, the progress indicator at bottom right kept showing 0%.
