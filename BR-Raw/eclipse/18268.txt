not finding images and files in NL-specific subdirectories

build 200205291235 Setup - Start eclipse. - Open the about dialog - Observe: There is a main image. - Exit eclipse. 1. Copy the file <install>/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/eclipse_lg.gif down into an NL-specific subdirectory; i.e., move it to <install>/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/nl/en/eclipse_lg.gif 2. Delete <install>/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/eclipse_lg.gif 3. Edit <install>/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/about.ini Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=$nl$/eclipse_lg.gif 4. Start eclipse 5. Open the about dialog Observe: There is no main image. Expectation: It should have found it in. 6. Edit <install>/eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.0/about.ini Change the value of the aboutImage property: aboutImage=nl/en/eclipse_lg.gif 7. Start eclipse 8. Open the about dialog Observe: There is a main image again. This suggests that the UI is correctly passing the entire path to IPluginDescriptor.find, but that the "$nl$" path segment is not being handled correctly.
