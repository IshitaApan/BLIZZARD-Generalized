[Commands] Stackoverflow in BindingSystem

Created attachment 182788 The stack We've just upgraded our RCP Application from 3.5.1 and it fails 50% of times on 3.6.1 with an Stackoverflow which destroys the command/handler system so that our RCP is left in a quite unuseable state. Our observation is that it has something do with Dialogs (Progress Dialog, MessageDialog, Preference Dialog, ...). At the moment they are opened which means the workbench window is loosing its focus the stackoverflow is observed in the back. This is a serious problem because there are upstream dependencies who force us more or less to go with 3.6.x so we can't easily stay in 3.5.x. I've currently no clue where I could start debugging this very problem to prevent it from happening - naturally there's the possibility that we are doing something illegal which only worked by chance. Nevertheless I've marked the bug as major because I think it marks a regression from 3.5.x.
