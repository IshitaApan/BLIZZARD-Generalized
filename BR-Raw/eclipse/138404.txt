[Problems] quick fix wizard opened with no options

N20060425 - see attachment https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=39419&action=edit - note that when openning the quick fix wizard it should not be empty. I'm not sure why the menu item was enabled in the problems view if there does not appear to be a quick fix for this problem
