[Perspectives] [ViewMgmt] Folder tab does not indicate current view when using multi-instance views

If a folder contains multiple views, switching between perspectives can result in the folders tab indicating that the wrong view is active. For example, lets say we have view "1", "2" and "3" inside of a folder. View "2" is active and so is it's corresponding folder tab. If you switch to a different perspective then switch back view "2" will be active but view "1"s tab will be. This may only be the case with views that have the same title. The expected behavior is that when you change perspectives, then change back, the view, and it's corresponding tab, that was active will still be active. I will attach a project that demonstrates this problem. Use the following instructions to test: 1. Import the com.foo project into your workspace 2. Run the com.foo.FooTest application as a Run-time Workbench 3. Switch to the Foo perspective 4. Create 3 or 4 view instances by clicking on the button in the "FooCounter" view 5. Use the "Widow-Open Perspective" menu to switch to a different perspective 6. Switch back to the foo perspective. 7. Try switching back and forth a couple of times. The view that is displayed is indicated by the button label in the FooCounter view. After switching a few times the active view and active folder tab are out of sync. I would expect the same view and view tab to be active when I change out of a perspective and change back to it.
