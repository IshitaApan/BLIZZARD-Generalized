[Import/Export] "Copy projects into workspace" remains checked after switching from archive to directory

build I20051101-0010 - go to Import > External Projects into Workspace - ensure that "Select root directory" is selected and "Copy projects into workspace" checkbox is unchecked - choose "Select archive file" - the "Copy projects into workspace" checkbox is checked and disabled - this is accurate - choose "Select root directory" again - the "Copy projects into workspace" checkbox is checked and enabled - this is an unwanted side-effect Should consider the "Copy projects into workspace" setting to be user state, which should not be overridden by the system, except when it does not apply (the archive case). That is, the state should be remembered separately for the directory case.
