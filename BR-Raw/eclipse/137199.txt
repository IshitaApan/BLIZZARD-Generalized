Generate Identifiers Test has very unstable Elapsed process

20060417 GenerateIdentifiersTest is all over the place on Elapsed Process but quite stable on CPU time on the slow Red Hat machine (it is fine on the others). As this does not give an accurate indication of performance currently I am going to switch it to CPU time for now until we can discover the cause of the inconsistency.
