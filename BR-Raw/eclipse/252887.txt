[PropertiesView] REGRESSION: Pressing F1 causes loss of editor properties

Build ID: IES 3.4.1 used in RAD 7.5.1 Steps To Reproduce: Our product (WebSphere Integration Developer 6.2) makes extensive use of the property sheet view to show/edit the properties of items selected in our editors. When focus is in the property sheet, pressing F1 is causing the Help View to become the active workbench part (this was not the behavior in 3.4.0 and earlier). When the Help View becomes the active part the contents of the property sheet view contributed by the editor are lost. The user is forced to re-select the item in the editor in order to continue to work on the properties they are editing. We make extensive use of F1 help to assist the user in editing properties. This regression in usability is a stop ship defect for WID 6.2 I have confirmed that this is also happening when using a RAD editor (web diagram). The attached screen shots show the effect of pressing F1 in the property sheet Note in the Before picture the help view is not the active part and the content of the properties view are maintained In the After picture the help view is the active part and the contents of the properties
