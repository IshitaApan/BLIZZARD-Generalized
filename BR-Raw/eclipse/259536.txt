[EditorMgmt] [Patch] Problems reloading a bundle

Created attachment 121103 Fixes support for reloading of editor extensions Build ID: M20080911-1700 I'm trying to reload a bundle using PackageAdmin. The bundle in question provides quite a few extensions, some of them being content types and editors, so reloading the bundle causes causes registry changes. During unloading, the removal of the extensions causes exceptions to be thrown: InvalidRegistryObjectException: "Invalid registry object" This is due to EditorRegistry.removeEditorFromMapping() calling FileEditorMapping.getEditors(), which then calls WorkbenchActivityHelper.restrictCollection() on the (now invalid) editor descriptors. The fix is to add a method FileEditorMapping.getAllEditors(), which does not filter by activities and use that. While I was at it I also took the liberty to implement //TODO remove from content type mappings (hopefully correctly).
