[WorkbenchParts] hideView does not work on perspective deactivate callback

I20060117-0800 Attempting to hide a view in the current perspective, when it is deactivated does not work. The view remains open, but its control disappears. Attached is an example plug-in (based on the "Plugin with a view" sample). The view adds itself as a perspective listener and attempts to hide itself when its perspective is deactivated. * import the attached zip file as an existing project * launch a new workspace, open Java perspective * Show View > Other... > Sample Category > Sample View * Open a new perspective * switch back to Java perspective > the view is still there (with its control missing) Debug wants to use the "hide" feature to hide views it automatically opened, when a perspective change occurrs, such that it does not leave views open. (there does not seem to be a way to close a view in a specific perspective, so we are opting to "clean" a perspective when the user changes perspectives).
