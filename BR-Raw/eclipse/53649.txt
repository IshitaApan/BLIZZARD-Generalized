[Workbench] Minimized views should yield real estate

Consider opening Java perspective with: 1. package explorer on the left (as usual) 2. an editor and the problems view stacked on top of each other on the right (as usual) If you 'minimize' the problems view, the editor gets the real estate previously occupied by it. If you 'minimize' the package explorer, it collapses into its title bar but the editor or problems view does not get anything out of it. All you see is a gray panel on the left. It's only beneficial to minimize views if there is another view below it. It would be good if views always yield its previously occupied space to the rest of the workbench on minimize. It could give priority to open views vertically above/below it so that current behaviour is not lost :)
