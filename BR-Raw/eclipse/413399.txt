[Trim] Lost of the default Package / Navigator view container

I've noticed miscellaneous bugs with the view management. Here are some of them (ones I can reproduce). Here's the first I just noticed while trying to reproduce other ones : The default container of the Package / Navigator / Project Explorer views, when minimized and while dragging it around, can be lost. The left mouse button is not released but the container does not appear anywhere. It is not docked into a default location or something (I checked and rechecked). And I can't make it reappear by trying to open that view with the Window > Show view menu. I must reinitialize the perspective to get it back. It seems it does not occur with the other minimized view containers, though the cursor can lost the container while dragging it and then it is automatically relocated at a default (or last) position but remains green as still being moved. More over, when I try to place the minimized Package view container at the left bottom corner, it doesn't want to keep that location after being maximized and minimized again ! Though, once placed at the left bottom corner, after a Eclipse restart, it remains at that location until I maximized&minimized it. The other view containers seem to be less sensible to that phenomena. And to finish on those view containers issues, on an other Kepler installation, I have troubles with the Package and Navigator views because they are duplicated, one or more times into the container, after being minimized&maximized. Very difficult to close the duplicates, and it seems impossible to fix... That bug is more difficult to reproduce, I'll try to provoke it again. Hope it's clear enough.
