[Preferences] Cancelling Compiler Error/Warning property page still puts them in effect

Eclipse 3.2 M4 When changing the "Non-externalized strings" field (under properties -> java compiler -> Errors/Warnings) from Ignore to Error a message appears stating that a project rebuild is required for the changes to take effect. Unfortunately, the rebuild still occurs even if the user clicks Cancel. Also, once the cancel button returns the user to the settings window the OK button is no longer available and the user must click the cancel button. Futhermore, even after the cancel button is clicked, the setting changes are still put into effect.
