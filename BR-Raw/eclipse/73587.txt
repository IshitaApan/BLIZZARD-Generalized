[RCP] Allow separation of declaration and placement of workbench extensions

R3.0 Currently, whenever a component like a view, preference page, or action set, is defined, it is also placed in the UI. That is, attributes like its label, icon, parent category, containing menu, etc. are defined in the same extension as the component itself. This is problematic for creating components designed to be reused in different applications, since this assumes a particular arrangement of containing menus, categories, labeling, etc. Presentation and placement of a component should be separable from the declaration of the component itself. As with the current way of doing things, we want to preserve the ability to refer to an component by id, without having to expose its implementation class as API. Some known cases are: - reusing the progress view: bug 71747, comment 2 - reusing the keys preference page: bug 73510 - update UI actions: bug 63081
