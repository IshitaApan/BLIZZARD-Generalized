[KeyBindings] Delete Key is not working in form editor

Build Identifier: 3.6.2.M20110210-1200 Hello, the delete key (SWT.DEL) is not working properly for CCombo. Following points have been observed: - The binding to the delete key seems to eat the keystroke (in WorkbenchKeyboard) - Although the CCombo internally uses a Text widget, the exception in WorkbenchKeyboard.filterKeySequenceBindings() for the Text widget is not working since the CCombo wraps the event into a new event which has the CCombo set as the events widget. Seems like either CCombo has to handle this special case differently or WorkbenchKeyboard includes CCombo (like Text, Combo and Browser) as an exception to the out of order processing. Looks like this is no issue if there is nothing bound to the delete command, but I would expect this to work even with something bound to the command (like the Text widget). Eclipse: 3.6.2.M20110210-1200 SWT: 3.6.2.v3659c Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an FormEditor 2. Add an editable CCombo 3. Add a handler to the command org.eclipse.ui.edit.delete 4. Try using delete in the CCombo
