Opening Eclipse with multiple editors leaves some blank

If Eclipse is opened with multiple editors already open (i.e., restored with the workbench state), then only the top-most editor will have any contents. The other editors will have no contents (painted with background colour). Closing on of those editors and opening it again, corrects the problem. The problem does not occur with editors opened after Eclipse is started. This occurs using I200404220800 and the latest code from HEAD in Platform UI, SWT, and Platform Core. The bug is highly visible, but does not interfere with functionality much. STEPS TO REPRODUCE: 1.) Start Eclipse 2.) Open two editors 3.) Exit Eclipse 4.) Start Eclipse 5.) Switch to the second editor OBSERVED RESULTS: The second editor is painted with the background colour. DESIRED RESULTS: The editor should have a StyledText widget with the contents of the file.
