[Preferences] GM/F4: Workbench appearance preferences ignored

Selections made with the Restore Defaults button in Workbench appearance preferences are ignored. To reproduce: Stack three views so that you observe their tab positions on the bottom of the views. This is the default. Now open Window->Preferences. Expand the Workbench tree item and select Appearance. Reverse the tab positions for Views and Editors. That is, select bottom for editors and top for views. Press Apply and OK. Reopen this Appearance page to observe that your changes are still selected. Restart Eclipse and observe that you changes have taken effect. Now reopen this Appearance page, and use the Restore Defaults button. The selections you made earlier go back to their defaults. Press Apply and Ok. Reopen the preferences page to observe that these changes have *not* persisted. Again, press Restore Defaults, Apply, and Ok. Restart Eclipse, and observe that the tab positions have *not* changed to reflect your Restore Defaults selection. Manual selection of the default values produces the desired result, but the Restore Defaults button does not. Observed on AIX and Linux Motif.
