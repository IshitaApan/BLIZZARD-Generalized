[About] Consider revising button contribution strategy in InstallationPage

Some of the things that are provided in the platform installation pages might be of general use to more clients. Consider promoting these concepts to API...They are listed in order of importance. - The about CopyHandler redirects the copy command to the page. We could make this handler API and add the copy protocol in InstallationPage so that any page could use this handler for easy copy support. Otherwise each page has to come up with their own handler. - The support for setting selection variables is currently provided in ProductInfoPage. We could consider promoting this concept to InstallationPage so that client pages need only hook selection handlers on their list and call some framework method. I'm not even sure a client could get this working without us doing something here (because InstallationDialogSourceProvider is not API). - We could consider a common handler and command for getting the details of a selection inside an installation page. This could open a properties page or expand a tray. - ConfigureColumnsHandler and columns command. If an installation page provides a table, the same handler and command could be used to manipulate columns. (Another thought is to just get rid of this dialog.)
