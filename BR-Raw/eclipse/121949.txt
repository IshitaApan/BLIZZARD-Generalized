[Wizards] The width of the button in the dialog of "Exitsting Projects into Workspace" doesn't extend when the dialog font is changed

The width of the button in the dialog of "Exitsting Projects into Workspace" doesn't extend when the dialog font is changed. The problem is included in the source code of the following packages. plug-in org.eclipse.ui.ide package org.eclipse.ui.internal.wizards.datatransfer class WizardProjectsImportPage I corrected it as follows; - The variables in createSelectionButtons method are changed to the field variables. ->	private Button selectAllButton; ->	private Button deselectAllButton; ->	private Button refreshButton; - In createSelectionButtons method, The instances of the button ware stored into the fields. ->	selectAllButton = new Button(buttonsComposite, SWT.PUSH); ->	deselectAllButton = new Button(buttonsComposite, SWT.PUSH); ->	refreshButton = new Button(buttonsComposite, SWT.PUSH); - In createControl method, setButtonLayoutData methods ware called after applyDialogFont method. 		createProjectsRoot(workArea); 		createProjectsList(workArea); 		Dialog.applyDialogFont(workArea); /*Add*/		setButtonLayoutData(selectAllButton); /*Add*/		setButtonLayoutData(deselectAllButton); /*Add*/		setButtonLayoutData(refreshButton);
