[Contributions] plugin.xml context menu should not have "Run Ant..." item

Problem Description: In a plugin project, both "plugin.xml" and "build.xml" items have "Run Ant..." in their context menu. However, if "Run Ant..." from the "plugin.xml" context menu is selected, the resulting dialog box complains that "Config file is not of expected XML type". Ant cannot be run. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Be sure you are in the Plug-in Developent perspective. Click on File->New- >Project. 2. Select "Plug-in Development" and "Plug-in Project" in the new project dialog. 3. Click "Next". 4. Enter "test" in the project name text field. Make sure the "Create a Java project" radio button is selected. Click "Next". 5. Make sure the "Create a plugin project using a code generation wizard" is selected. Click on "Hello, World" in the lower left pane. 6. Click "Finish" 7. Expand "test" in the package explorer. Left Click on "plugin.xml". Right click to bring up its context menu. Select "Create Ant Build File". (!BUG!: note that "Run Ant..." is available in the context menu at this point). This will create the file/item "build.xml". 8. Left click on "plugin.xml". Right-click on it to bring up the context menu. Select "Run Ant...". !BUG! A "modify attributes and launch" dialog window appears, but it complains that "Config file is not of expected XML type". Ant cannot be run. Found in: OS: HP-UX 11.11. Eclipse: V2.1 Build Id: 200302061700 (M5) Comments: This also applies to the "fragment.xml" file in a plugin fragment project. It should not have "Run Ant..." in its context menu. Selecting "Run Ant..." from "build.xml"'s context menu displays the correct behaviour i.e. the "modify attributes and launch" dialog window opens and does not complain, and Ant can be run (click "Run" on the dialog window) without problem.
