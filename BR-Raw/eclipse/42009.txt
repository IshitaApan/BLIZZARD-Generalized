[KeyBindings] Ctrl+Shift+F switches input mode in KeySequenceText on GTK

Some key strokes shift the input mode by default in GTK, which breaks the way the KeySequenceText widget is supposed to work. One example is Ctrl+Shift+F. Instead of the desired character, a strange other character is inserted, and the key sequence is not modified. This character cannot be deleted. STEPS TO REPRODUCE: 1.) Open the KeysPreferencePage and change focus to the KeySequenceText widget. 2.) Type Ctrl+Shift+F ACTUAL RESULTS: An underlined 'F' is inserted in the text widget, and the key sequence is not affected. EXPECTED RESULTS: Ctrl+Shift+F should be inserted, and the key sequence updated.
