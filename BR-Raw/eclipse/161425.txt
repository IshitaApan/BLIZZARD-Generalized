[Viewers] TableTreeViewer => EditingSupport broken

Our current CVS-HEAD-Version of TableEditorImpl breaks editing support for TableTreeViewer (no ViewerRow,...) although I don't have a test-case to prove my feeling. 2 possibilities: A) integrate TableEditorImpl 1.7 into TableTreeEditorImpl B) revert TableEditorImpl back to 1.7 C) refactor TableTreeViewer to use our new ViewerRow implementation How to work around this depends how we proceed in bug #153993.
