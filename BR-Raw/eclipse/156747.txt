Adopt Resource.getDevice() in the JFace resource managers

SWT has recently added a Resource.getDevice() method. This allows several improvements to be made to the JFace resource managers: 1. The (inefficient and complex) heuristics that detect a device by creating temporary resources can be removed. 2. The one-argument descriptor factories that don't take a Device can be made just as efficient as the two-argument versions. 3. The descriptor factory methods that take a Device can be deprecated, since the second argument is no longer required and the one-argument version is just as efficient.
