[Compatibility] DirectContributionItem enablements never updated

Created attachment 208475 initial patch BuildId: 4.2M4 Old-style Actions, without a command identifier, added to an editor toolbar never have their enablement status updated. These actions are transformed by MenuHelper#createToolItem(MApplication application, ActionContributionItem item) into MDirectToolItems, and rendered as DirectContributionItems. Unlike MHandledToolItems (and its rendered equivalent, HandlledContributionItem), DirectContributionItems have no periodic timer to check the item enablement, nor are there any property listeners registered with the action to trigger updates. Given that these items have an action, the attached patch leverages uses an action's property notification to update the item's label, tooltip, and image changes too. I realize this is just one-half of a solution, since it doesn't communicate model changes back to the action (e.g., selection changed).
