[Markers] QuickFix dialog doesn't show Location properly

Build ID: M20080911-1700 In the Problems view I have an error which 'Location' is the name of a file instead of a line number. If I open the QuickFix window it displays 'Unknown' in the 'Location' column instead of the file name, as it is showed in the problems view. I think the error is in org.eclipse.ui.internal.views.markers.QuickFixPage class. There, in createMarkerTable(Composite control) method, when creating a new ITableLabelProvider, you are getting the column text using IMarker.LINE_NUMBER instead of IMarker.LOCATION, which I guess would be the correct attribute.
