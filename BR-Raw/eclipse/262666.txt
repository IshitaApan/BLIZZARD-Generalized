[EditorMgmt] EditorErrorPart fails on create

Found in I20090127-0100. If you have an open editor whose implementation bundle is unavailable we no longer get an 'error' part but the tab does -nothing- when clicked except activate. The contents are whatever was left over from the previously active editor. Setup: Create a fresh workspace and check the org.eclipse.ui.examples.propertysheet project (gets you a '.usr' editor) Run an inner, create a new plugin project (gets us a manifest editor) add a 'foo.usr' file to it (gets us a .usr editor) Close the inner Now, close the examples project and re-run the inner. When we closed the 'foo' editor was active but now the manifest editor is up...but when you click on it the editor contents stay as they were (showing the manifest form). Close the manifest editor (leaving only the bogus one). Now, double click on the editor area (as if to maximize)...views start disappearing!! trace coming...
