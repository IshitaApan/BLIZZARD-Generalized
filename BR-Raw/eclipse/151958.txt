[Markers] Custom problem filter not updated

- create a minimal plugin with a plugin.xml like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <?eclipse version="3.2"?> <plugin> 	<extension point="org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport"> 	 <problemFilter 	 name="Problems" 	 id="markererror.myPlugin.filterId" 	 enabled="true" 	 scope="ON_ANY_IN_SAME_CONTAINER"> 	 <selectedType/> 	 </problemFilter> 	</extension> </plugin> - start a runtime workbench, introduce a compile error in a Java class to get a problem marker. - in the problems view, disable the default filter, the filter "Problems" remains activated. - no markers are shown in the problem view. I debugged a little and found that the method MarkerFilter.setFocusResource() is only called for the default filter, not for the plugin-defined "Problems" filter: The latter filter is only contained in the field MarkerView.enabledFilters. The field MarkerView.markerFilters contains only the default filter.
