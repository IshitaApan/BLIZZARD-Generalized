[KeyBindings] Always include unbound commands

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #190281 +++ The new Keys preference page has an option for "Include unbound commands". Request: Please remove the checkbox, and always show unbound commands. Justification: - This may cause confusion for users who go to the page in order to bind a key to an unbound command. If they don't notice the preference, they won't see the command they are looking for. - Anyone who wants to only see bound commands can already do so in one click by sorting by Binding. The extra checkbox just adds clutter to an already-busy preference page. - The preference causes problems for swapping two commands. If you unbind the first command before binding the second, the first command you are working with will simply disappear.
