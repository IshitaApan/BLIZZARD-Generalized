[ActivityMgmt] Activities pattern bindings should provide the option to use non-regular Expression strings

Build ID: I20071101-2000 Steps To Reproduce: It is expected that you know how to use Activities. 1. Open the manifest editor, go to the Extension page. Create an entry at the extension point: "org.eclipse.ui.activities". 2. Create an Activity. 3. Create an ActivityPatternBinding. Use a binding which contains the full non-modified id of the object, e.g. "a.b.c.d.e.f.g" - without any backslashes. 4. Use your activity with the given pattern. It won't bind! More information: If you have a deep nested id (like org.company.for.anotherCompany.branch.fork.native.win.win32.menu.menuX.menuPoint), it can become _very_ annoying to write such strings over and over as a regular expression with a dozen backslashes. It's also harder to read. And a solution to stay API compatible and allow non-regex strings can be easy implemented. I implemented already a solution in Bug 201052. The necessary code-changes in the parts which actual check if the pattern fits are really small: Before: public boolean isMatch(String toMatch) {	 return pattern.matcher(toMatch).matches();		 }	 After: public boolean isMatch(String toMatch) { if (nonRegExp) { return patternString.equals(toMatch); } return pattern.matcher(toMatch).matches();		 }	 To make things easier I recommend to implement the option to commit non-regexp strings as: an option. An extra boolean field which determines if the string is a reg-exp or not.
