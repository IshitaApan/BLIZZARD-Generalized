[Problems View] Problems view opens up in Compare view

Sorry about "no steps". I have a bunch of problems in a project that I don't care about. I have the filter set to problems only on the selected item. When I am browsing incoming changes, the Problems view keeps opening and making my compare view small. I keep closing it and it keeps opening. The thing I do that is different is that I always have a project around with lots of errors (because it won't compile on every platform).
