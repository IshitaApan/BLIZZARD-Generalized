[DND] Editor closed and content lost when dropping detached editor's tab outside its window

4.3 RC4 Make an editor dirty (change some content) and then drag it outside the workbench window to create a detached editor shell. Create a new workbench window, and then drag the detached editor's tab into the new workbench window. Expected: Either drop cursor becomes "cannot drop" and dropping does nothing, or drop works and the dirty editor ends up in the new window. Was: Editor is closed without any questions, and my content changes are lost.
