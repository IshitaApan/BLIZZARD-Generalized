[Wizards] Two error messages interact in two different wizards

There is a required field in wizard A, so there is an error message shown in this wizard A like "*** can't be empty"; to enter this field, there is a "New" button next to this field, so click New button to pop up another wizard B, enter an invalid value in wizard B, it will display an error message in wizard B, then the error message can be disappeared after the correct valued entered, click Finish button in wizard B. Now it goes back to wizard A, the value which entered in wizard B is displayed in wizard A, so the error message "*** can't be empty" should be disapperared from wizard A, but the error message is still there. The problem may caused by org.eclipse.jface.util.Policy.java, there is a static field animator, which shares by others.
