Workspace failed to start due to Problems View getting activated outside SWT Display Thread

Created attachment 199138 Workspace log showing exceptions Build ID: Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) 1-time occurrence, see attached workspace log, here is my understanding of what happened: - This was an existing fairly complex Indigo install with several dropins - I added another *.link file to dropins (adding egit) and launched - During launch, following exception was logged (p2 race condition?) org.osgi.framework.BundleException: State change in progress for bundle - Eclipse tried to bring up the Problems View - But that failed due to org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Invalid thread access - Which caused the whole Eclipse Launch to terminate. On relaunching, everything was fine so the config itself looked OK. I'm reporting this since I've seen similar problems with the framework trying to activate the Problems View prematurely on other occasions too.
