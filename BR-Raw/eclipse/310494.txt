[LinkedResources] Preference "Link and create virtual folders" does not work

I20100425-2000 The 2 options on the Linked Resourced with name "Link and create virtual folders" don't work. When they are selected, dropping items does nothing. In CopyFilesAndFoldersOperation#copyOrLinkFiles(..), the test "hasFlag(dropOperation, ImportTypeDialog.IMPORT_VIRTUAL_FOLDERS_AND_LINKS)" always fails because dropOperation is always COPY.
