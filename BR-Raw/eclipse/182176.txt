Need API that allows RCP apps/splash to update the UI synchronously/asynchronously

The fix for bug 178875 prevents arbitrary asyncExec calls from being run while the workbench is being initialized. If an implementation of AbstractSplashHandler wishes to update the UI via some background thread it will no longer be possible. We have a similar case in the BasicSplashHandler already - callers to the various ProgressMonitor methods may come from non-UI threads (spawned by OSGi bundle activation). We currently handle these message by wrapping them in one of our special StartupRunnable wrappers. We need to make this ability public. I would suggest cleaning up and promoting BasicSplashHandler.updateUI() to API. This method takes an arbitrary runnable and runs it in the UI thread. Given that only custom splash handlers can access this method I believe it to be a very safe change.
