UI failures in N20080416-2000 appear to be caused by SWT changes

If I PartsReferencesTests (UI code) from HEAD against last weeks SWT contribution everything passes. However, if I check out SWT from HEAD I see the same failures that are present in the build. These tests are peculiar in that they create and dispose displayed with regularity. Has anything changed on Carbon in this area recently?
