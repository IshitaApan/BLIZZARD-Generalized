[Workbench] Exiting while saving can cause problems

This seems to be a problem with either the workbench in general or the editor structure in particular. I have reproduced this with the Java editor but there is no reason why it wouldn't occur with other editors as well. Dirty a Java editor. Press Ctrl+S to save the editor. While it is saving, quickly close the main perspective window, either by clicking the X or by choosing File->Save. When prompted to save dirty resources say Okay. An error dialog appears stating that the save failed, and a stack trace is printed to the log (sorry, I don't have my log anymore, but it's fairly easy to reproduce). The dialog says: "Problems occurred while trying to save the state of the workbench." Details: "Save cannot be called from inside an operation." I guess the real problem is that I'm able to exit while a workspace operation is taking place. Reproduced on both Win2K and Linux.
