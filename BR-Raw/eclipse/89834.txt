[Presentations] Allow for unanticipated parameters for part appearance and behavior

This is a follow up to bug 86357. The presentations API needs to have some capability for custom or otherwise unanticipated parameters. The current list of parameters is limited to just name, content description and one image. While those parameters may be sufficient for some or even most situations, they are not sufficient for all.
