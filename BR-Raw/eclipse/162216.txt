[JFace] org.eclipse.jface.snippets doesn't work on linux

I picked up platform-ui and platform-ui-test today from HEAD and got org.eclipse.jface.snippets ... which won't compile with an error. Severity and Description	Path	Resource	Location	Creation Time	Id The project was not built since the source file /org.eclipse.jface.snippets/Eclipse JFace Snippets/org/eclipse/jface/snippets/viewers/Snippet010OwnerDraw.java could not be read		org.eclipse.jface.snippets	Unknown	1161784128418	7238 I looks like it was checked into HEAD using some strange encoding, and eclipse won't open it using eclipse-linux standard UTF-8 PW
