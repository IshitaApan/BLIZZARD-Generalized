[Themes] [europa] appearance preference page corrupted after switch wks

Problem found using Version: 3.3.0 Build id: I20070323-1616 (3.3.M6) with europa install. NOT reproduced with a base 3.3M6 build. Steps to reproduce: - start Eclipse against default wks - go to Window --> Preferences --> Appearance - modify defaults and position the Perspective switcher to the top left position - apply changes and restart the workbench against the same wks - Select File --> Switch Workspace --> Other - enter an alternate wks location, - expand the Copy settings section and select (check) Workbench Layout and Working Sets - click OK button - once restarted, close the welcome page --> note that the Perspective switcher is back to the default position (whereas other settings seems to have been copied ok) In order to position the Perspective switcher to the top left position, go to Window --> Preferences --> Appearance --> you get an error message that claims that current preference page contains invalid value --> an IllegalArgumentException is displayed in the console (to be attached files) Still did not find any workaround to position the Perspective switcher to the top left position (clear worksapce or clear then re-install europa config)
