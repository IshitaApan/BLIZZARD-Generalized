Circular dependancy introduced by bug 206064

I was running a test build this afternoon and noticed that the changes in bug 206064 to the org.eclipse.ui.ide manifest cause the build to fail due to circular dependancies. The crux of the problem is that the require-bundles in the various manifests go like this org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources requires org.eclipse.ui.ide requires org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring requires org.eclipse.compare requires org.eclipse.ui.ide which is a circular dependancy This may work in your workspace where the bundles already exist. But in the build, pde build generates build scripts based on dependancies and we like our family trees to branch :-) Build N20071024-1653 (Timestamp: 200710241653): The following error occurred while executing this line: /builds/N/org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder/buildAll.xml:144: The following error occurred while executing this line: /builds/N/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build/scripts/build.xml:64: The following error occurred while executing this line: /builds/N/org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder/eclipse/buildConfigs/sdk/customTargets.xml:13: The following error occurred while executing this line: /builds/N/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build/scripts/genericTargets.xml:85: A cycle was detected when generating the classpath org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources_3.3.100.N20071024-1653, org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.3.100.N20071024-1653, org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring_3.4.0.N20071024-1653, org.eclipse.compare_3.4.0.N20071024-1653, org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.3.100.N20071024-1653.
