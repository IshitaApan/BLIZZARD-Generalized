Old welcome support appears when the "new" intro is defined

Build Identifier: M20110909-1335 Hi, In Eclipse Indigo 3.7, selecting Help/Welcome is opening WelcomeEditor instead of Eclipse WelcomePage. This could be detected only when any of the eclipse plugins have a WelcomePage(Welcome.xml) defined in plugin properties(about.ini). In Eclipse Helios(3.6) this problem is not present. I have debugged both the eclipse code and found the probable cause. Below are my observations, I hope this helps to track the problem. * The deprecated class QuickStartAction and the new class IntroAction are sharing the same ActionDefinitionId, "org.eclipse.ui.help.quickStartAction". * As two actions share same Id, the action which is instantiated at last is getting invoked first. * In Eclipse 3.6, the order of instantiation is QuickStartAction, then IntroAction. So whenever we click Welcome from Help menu the UniversalIntro page is getting opened. * In Eclipse 3.7, Class IntroAction is removed and defined as anonyms class for the class variable ActionFactory.Intro and the order of instantiation ActionFactory.Intro followed by QuickStartAction class. So whenever Help/Welcome is selected WelcomeEditor is opened. * If no plugin have WelcomePage defined, the QuickStartAction class is skipped and the UniversalIntroPage is opened. So the problem won't be visible on eclipse Indigo unless any plugin have welcomePage defined. As one of my third party plugin is having welcomePage defined, My customized UniversalIntro page is not being displayed on Eclipse 3.7 It would be really helpful if you could provide a work around. Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install eclipse platform 2.Add an welcome.xml to the eclipse platform plugin, "org.eclipse.platform_3.7.XX" 3.Run eclipse. Initially WelcomePage is shown. 4.Close it and reopen from Help>Welcome. Welcome Editor will be opened instead of UniversalWelcomePage. This could also be reproduced by installing any plugin with welcome.xml, For eg. Spring IDE.
