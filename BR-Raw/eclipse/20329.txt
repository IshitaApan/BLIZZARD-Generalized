[Preferences] Editors preference page starts with space

Build: 20020612 The Editors preference page begins with a space, making it appear that its top margin is very wide. In EditorsPreferencePage.createContents(Composite), at line 65, is this line: 	WorkbenchPreferencePage.createSpace(composite); which adds the leading space before any of the page contents. This should be removed.
