Improve the FileListControl

Created attachment 151177 patch 1 FileListControl, which provides the UI for Macros, Includes, and Library path selection is rather limited. The attached patch adds the following functionality: - Add Copy, paste, select all handlers - Add Undo, Redo - Add multiple selection (with copy & paste) - Project relative workspace paths are automatically converted to ${workspace_loc:${ProjName}/...} - Can Add Multiple workspace resources simultaneously - Tweak "Are you sure you want to delete..." => Are you sure you want to remove..." (less scary; files aren't actually deleted...) - On Edit, the select in "Workspace ..." dialog, attempts to select the resource represented by the current text - Fix warnings - Make BROWSE_NONE, BROWSE_FILE, BROWSE_DIR API as they're needed for dialog construction and there's no dependency on managedbuild from cdt.ui The patch allows the user to rapidly populate these configuration options using copy and paste. Quickly add multiple include paths simultaneously, and automatically set ProjectVariable relative paths for workspace paths. The user is still free to specify path strings as they see fit, the improvements just provide a better default. Comments welcome.
