[BiDi] BIDI3.6: Triggering Eclipse mirroring and Bidi-script based languages translation

Eclipse Mirroring and translation to a Bidi-script based language should be coupled together, Eclipse must be mirrored only if it is translated to a Bidi-script based language, and it shall not be allowed to be launched in a Bidi-script based language translation unless it is mirrored, the current behavior doesn't guarantee this Description of current behavior : In general, the language in which Eclipse is launched is by default triggered by the system locale value i.e. if machine locale is English, it will be launched LTR and in English and if the machine locale is French and eclipse French NL packs are installed, it will be launched in LTR and in French. This default launch language can be overridden using "-nl <locale>" argument. Now, for Arabic/Hebrew, we have identified the following two erroneous behavior: If the machine locale is Arabic and Arabic NL packs are installed (and -nl ar argument is not used), eclipse is launched in LTR mode but translated If the Arabic NL packs are missing and -nl ar argument is used (regardless of the machine locale), eclipse is launched in RTL mode but (expectedly) in English The suggested behavior (to be implemented through this bug) Eclipse is to be launched in RTL and with Arabic/Hebrew translated UI strings only in the following two cases: Machine locale is Arabic/Hebrew and corespondent NL packs are installed Machine locale is non-Bidi, "-nl ar/he/iw" is used and corespondent NL packs are installed The command line option "-dir" , which is used to force the mirroring of Eclipse when it is launched, should be removed, or at least, to be considered obsolete , as the new proposed behavior will not require it Note : The Arabic/Hebrew languages are the immediate targets of this bug, further investigation is be done in future for other Bidi script based languages (Farsi, Urdu)
