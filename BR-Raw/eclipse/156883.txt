[Viewers] enhancements to ILazyTreeContentProvider

Based on ILazyTreeContentProvider 3.2, I would like to suggest the following enhancements be considered: * Currently, a lazy tree content provider provides a child count for a parent, and updates each child by index. When a tree node is visible, but not expanded, it would be sufficient to ask a model element if it has children, rather than how many. It is sometimes more efficient for a model element to know that it has children, rather than determining exactly how many. Of course, when a node is expanded, asking it how many children it has is fine. (see related bug 156441). * The lazy tree content provider is based on model elements (objects). However, since the standard JFace tree viewer supports multiple duplicate elements at different locations in the same tree (based on tree paths), the content provider should also have the option to retrieve/specify content by path rather than just model element. With the current API, every occurrence of a model element must have the same content.
