[Dialogs] Low Vision test - hover test is not present for icons in MessageDialogs

Our testers found that MessageDialog (org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.MessageDialog) dialogs do not conform to Low Vision compliance quidelines (T&M 162A). There is no hover text for the icons is these dialogs. See below for test case of Low Vision Compliance. High Contrast: Under Control Panel_accessibility_display tab change to high contrast white or yellow on a black background. This test will remove color and render everything on screen in black and white. These settings are used by low vision users who can only see text when there is a high degree of contrast between the foreground and background colors, as well as some color blind users. Text must not be illegible, gray, or any other color other than black and white (or yellow depending on the settings you chose). "Bleed through" (the text behind a control shows within the control) on any controls or text should also be reported. Check that alt text is present on each icon by using the mouse to "hover over" the icon.
