IActivityPatternBinding not filtering contributed menu items

Build Identifier: I20120531-1500 I have an activity defined using patterns that hides menu items which previously works with 3.6->3.8. I see my contributed capability listed, but the menu items that match the pattern do not get removed. For instance, I am testing with trying to hide the update menu item from p2. It is defined in it's plugin org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk as: <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.commands"> <command name="%Update.command" id="org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update"> </command> </extension> <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.menus"> <menuContribution locationURI="menu:help?after=additions"> <command commandId="org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update" 	 mnemonic="%Update.command.mnemonic" id="org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update"> </command> </menuContribution> </extension> In my plugin, I am trying to filter it out using any series of combinations including: <activityPatternBinding activityId="my.test.activity" isEqualityPattern="false" pattern="org\.eclipse\.equinox\.p2\.ui\.sdk/org\.eclipse\.equinox\.p2\.ui\.sdk\.update"> </activityPatternBinding> with other combinations attempted including some that would appear wrong based on documentation: .*/org\.eclipse\.equinox\.p2\.ui\.sdk\.update org\.eclipse\.equinox\.p2\.ui\.sdk/.* .*/org\.eclipse\.equinox\.p2\.ui\.sdk\.update I debugged MutableActivityManager and I do not see any of the menu items from the target plugin being queried for. Certainly I am potentially looking in the wrong code, but ostensibly I see other menu items like file open, etc. being correctly iterated. As this is a one of the key roles for activity bindings, I believe this is a priority issue for release. Other E4 references imply this would be the correct approach, such as: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/ide4edu-dev/msg00155.html Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add activity via plugin.xml matching to an existing contributed menu item 2. Make sure the capability (activity) is turned off in Preferences 3. Confirm menu item is still visible, restart Eclipse, and confirm again I will tidy up a bit my test plugin and attach to this bug shortly.
