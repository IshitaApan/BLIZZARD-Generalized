[Linked Resources] build classpath wizard should present linked folders like workbench

Build I20021210 1. Create a new Java project P1 with source folder "/P1/src". 2. Select P1 and create a New Folder /P1/fold1 Observe: New Folder dialog has an "Advanced >" button that hides the machinery for creating a linked folder. 3. Select P1 and open Properties > Java Build Path 4. On the Source tab, select Add Existing Folders 5. Select Create New Folder Observe: New Folder dialog exposes all the machinery for creating a linked folder. Expectation: JDT New Folder dialogs should look like the workbench New Folder dialog and have an "Advanced >" button that hides the machinery for creating a linked folder. The rationale for using an "Advanced >" button to keep the linking stuff out of sight is that (a) this is an advanced feature that most users will not use, and, more importantly (b) the linked resource feature is a 2.1 change that will break plug-ins that are unprepared to handle linked resources. We may loosen up in future releases, but for 2.1 we want to keep linked resources low key.
