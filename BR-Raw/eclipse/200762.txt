[FieldAssist] SimpleContentProposalProvider filters out exact matches

Build ID: I20070625-1500 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Trigger content assist on a field that uses org.eclipse.jface.fieldassist.AutoCompleteField with SimpleContentProposalProvider 2. If one of the choices is 'foo' and another is 'foobar', typing 'foo' in the field will remove it from the list of proposals leaving 'foobar' selected. If the user presses the enter key, foobar is placed in the field instead of 'foo'. More information: To fix the problem, change line 70: From: if (proposals[i].length() > contents.length() To: if (proposals[i].length() >= contents.length()
