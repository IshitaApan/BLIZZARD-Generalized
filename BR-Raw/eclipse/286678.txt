UI model and propagation of context values: containers with variables

Created attachment 144584 Patch This is the second half of the bug 286444. The general problem is propagation values up in the context tree. The bug 286444 added ability to modify context values in the original context; this enhancement is about declaring variables that can be modified on UI model. In the UI model we'll have some sort of containers grouping UI parts. In the current incarnation, it is MPart. This enhancement adds a list of String elements called "variables" to MPart's. The names in the list will be used to declare those variables on MPart's context and make them modifiable by UI elements contained by the MPart. For instance, for the Model Viewer the XMI will be: <children xsi:type="application:MSashForm" ...> <variables>selection</variables> <children xsi:type="application:MContributedPart" name="Model View".../> ... </children> In future, the role of MSash / MStack might be modified, but we'll still need some form of containers (for instance, for the workbench window). At that time the "variables" attribute will be moved from MPart to the new container. The bug 286444 and this enhancement will cover "implicit" propagation of the context values up the tree. The one last case - propagation of values to other nodes (not ancestors or descendants), in my opinion, will best be covered by an event notification mechanism.
