Editors no longer activate when clicking on their tabs

1. Open an editor. 2. Activate a view 3. Try to activate the editor by clicking on its tab item. 4. The editor's stack doesn't turn blue. Regression caused by changes for bug 320100 in StackRenderer between v1.13 and v1.14. When we query the model service for the active perspective of the part stack, we don't find anything because it is contained within a placeholder so there is no intermediate perspective parent between itself and the window.
