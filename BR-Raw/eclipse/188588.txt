[KeyBindings] [KeyBindings] missing keyboard shortcut for opening a view in my RCP app

Hi, I was creating an application based on RCP Mail Example and I found something that seem to be a bug. I declared a command,menu,handler and a binding ( using org.eclipse.ui.commands,org.eclipse.ui.menus,org.eclipse.ui.handlers,org.eclipse.ui.bindings) All declaratively. The command has a commandParameter and is used to open a view. It opens a view when I choose it from the menu or use the keybinding.The shortcut appears in Key Assist of the application. The problem is that it does not appear in menu next to the corresponding label. In RCP Mail Example it is menu File->'Open Another Message View'. I found similar bug on BugZilla https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=159120 but it was opened some time ago. I've tried changing the shortcut to another but the problem stays. I've checked it on Eclipse 3.3M6, 3.3M7, 3.3RC1.
