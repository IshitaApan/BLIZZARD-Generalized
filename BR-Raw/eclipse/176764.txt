[Undo] - DeleteResourcesOperation does not handle overlapped selections

In a project, create a folder f1. In f1, create another folder f2. Select f1 and f2 delete The undo fails with a "not enough info to restore" message. The problem is that the resource description for f2 checks to see whether f2's parent is valid, and at the time of the check, f1 has not been restored. Either the validity check needs to be smarter, or else the deletes should be collapsed into just f1.
