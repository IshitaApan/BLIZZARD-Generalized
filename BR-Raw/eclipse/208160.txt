[JFace] Request for RowLayoutFactory

Created attachment 81673 GridLayoutFactory The default margins for the RowLayout are not ideal for the standard case in which the consumer has a row of controls to position within an existing composite of controls. Moreover, the extended margins are used by default, and so the consumer must set four margins individually. Individuals familiar with GridLayouts will probably try to set marginHeight and marginWidth to zero to correct the problem as well, causing added confusion. For passivity reasons it is not a good idea to change these values, as they are specified explicitly in the RowLayout API. A RowLayoutFactory similar to the existing GridLayoutFactory would be quite useful for creating RowLayouts, and I believe we should add one to Eclipse 3.4. I have created an initial attempt at this based on the standards set down by the GridLayoutFactory. I feel this does an adequate job as-is, but I would welcome any constructive criticism or additions to fit other use-cases.
