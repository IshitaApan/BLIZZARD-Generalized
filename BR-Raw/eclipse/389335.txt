CommandContributionItem IBindingManagerListener leak

I am using the Git Staging View to see this problem. I have one unstaged file in my repository. Right-click on the changed file to view the pop-up menu. In debug I have a breakpoint in BindingManager.addBindingManagerListener(IBindingManagerListener). 2 of those listeners are added for 2 different CommandContributionItems every time I view that pop-up menu. Those listeners are never removed. The listeners are notified when an editor is opened, closed, and many other window actions. You can see that with a breakpoint in BindingManager.fireBindingManagerChanged(BindingManagerEvent). The list of listeners just keeps growing. Closing the view or perspective does not remove the listeners. This looks like one major reason that my performance degrades over time (bug 385272). Sorry if this is a duplicate, it seems different than the recent ones Dani has entered (bug 389250 bug 389257).
