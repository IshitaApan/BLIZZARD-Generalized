[Import/Export] Refresh button does not update list of projects

Refresh button does not update list of projects Steps to reproduce 1. Invoke Import Existing Projects wizard 2. Select any folder as the root directory [List of project will be shown] 3. Copy another project into that folder 4. Press Refresh The new project is not shown. I would expect that the Refresh button rescans the directory for new projects.
