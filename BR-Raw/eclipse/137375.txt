[Trim] too many resize calls

N20060418-0010 - In debugging some HeapStatus code I noticed that just on starting up the workbench I receive many computeSize calls. This must affect performance. Here are my results on starting up an inner workspace: 1) first computeSize from updateLayoutDataForContents as a result of restoring the workbench 2) second computeSize is a result of the Shell.setVisible() call which opens the workbench and causes the shell to layout 3) third is a result of an arrange call from the TrimLayout 4) the fourth is a result of another arrange call after a test for showRaggedTrim 5) the fifth looks like the fouth 6) TrimCommonUIHandle computesize calls compute size on the HeapStatus 7) the seventh looks like the fourth 8) the eigth looks like the sixth 9) looks like the fourth Computing the size 9 times can't be right.
