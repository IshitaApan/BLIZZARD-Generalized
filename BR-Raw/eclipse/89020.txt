[Undo] Operation throws assertion failure if undo limit is set to 0

I20050324-0800 Unfortunately existing clients of text's undo manager were allowed to set any number without failing. This is no longer possible: an assertion failure occurrs if the limit is smaller than 1. I will add code on my side that will handle the negative numbers but the operation history must allow 0.
