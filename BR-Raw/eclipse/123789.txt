[WorkbenchParts] 'Maximize' state should be view, not folder-bound

Maximize/minimize/restore state is currently folder-bound i.e. maximazing a view that is stacked with other views in a folder actually maximizes the entire folder. I keep having mental problems with it because in my mind I am changing the state of the active view only. The following scenario is the most problematic: 1) Maximize the active view in the folder 2) Close it while maximized Expectation: The view is closed and everything is restored back to normal Result: The next active view in the folder takes the closed view's place as maximized. Where this becomes really problematic is with the Intro part. Intro part is created as a sticky view internally. The following scenario is very unfortunate: 1) Press 'F1' to open the dynamic help view 2) While it is open, select Help>Welcome from the menu to open the Intro 3) Observe: Intro's tab is shown next to the Help view's tab 4) Close the Intro. Help view replaces it as maximized. This is very confusing to users because they would expact to restore their workbench back to normal when they close Intro. We need a way to control this behaviour and restrict the 'maximise' state to the active view only.
