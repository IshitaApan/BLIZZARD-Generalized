DCR: When zooming in on an editor, zoom in on the whole workbook (1GKBCK5)

If I have a bunch of editors open and I double click on the tab of one editor, that editor becomes maximized but only that editor. It appears as a single tab in a tab folder. It would be better if ALL the editors in that editor workbook were maximized for the following reasons: 1) If I want to browse the code in several classes in the maximized mode I have to double click to maximize file A, double click to minimize file A, and then double click to maximize file B. That is a lot of clicking. 2) The current code actually does a lot of work. It deletes all the tabs except the active tab when you maximize the file, it remembers the order of the tabs that were deleted and then when you minimize the editor, it has to recreate the tabs in the right order. If you implement this DCR you will actually delete code to get more functionality and it will be faster and less flashy. 3) There is no saving in real-estate with the current implementation. The space to show all the tabs is the same space as to show the one tab. NOTES: 	CM (9/20/2001 3:59:58 PM) 		Concur whole-heartedly.
