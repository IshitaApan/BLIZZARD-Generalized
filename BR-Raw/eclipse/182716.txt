[IDE] Improve 'New' menu regarding projects

20070417 The 'New' menu looks as follows in the Java perspective: | Project... | |------------| | Package | | Class | | Interface | ... | Other... | -------------- The entries in the list are defined by the perspective. The list of items should not contain projects as for projects 'Projects...' should be used The problem is, that creating new projects takes a lot of steps. It should be as easy to find as for other elements Suggestion: | Project >|| Java Project | |------------|| Plug-In Project | | Package ||-----------------| | Class || Others... | | Interface |------------------- ... The list of available projects is again defined by the perspective (as already done in the 'New Project' selection dialog). This idea comes from the discussion in bug 181040 (Remove 'New Java Project' from toolbar) and is IMO a requirement to go on with bug 181040. I believe that this could be doable for M7 as polish item with the existing APIs and extension point. If we agree on the idea, JDT/UI would volunteer to provide a patch.
