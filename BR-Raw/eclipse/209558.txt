[Import/Export] FileSystemImportWizard and FileSystemExportWizard require the compatibility plug-in

Build ID: M20070921-1145 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Create an RCP app. 2.Add an export wizard to plugin.xml, pointing to org.eclipse.ui.wizards.datatransfer.ZipFileExportWizard. Could also just invoke it from code, like in an action. 3.Attempt to run the wizard and observe the error message. More information: ZipFileImportWizard, ExternalProjectImportWizard, PreferencesImportWizard, and PreferencesExportWizard can be brought up fine in the same RCP app, while FileSystemImportWizard and FileSystemExportWizard issue the message. The difference is that the wizards which start up call WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault(), while the ones which don't call the deprecated method Platform.getPlugin(). I figured out that adding the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in to the dependency list allows all the wizards to start up without the message. It seems like perhaps all these classes ought to be calling WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault() now.
