[Compatibility] PerspectiveSwitcher does not respect Open-New-Perspective in New Window setting

Created attachment 203098 Patch PerspectiveSwitcher to use IWorkbench#showPerspective() The Perspective Switcher doesn't respect the user's "Open New Perspective In New Window" setting. I don't see that there should be a difference in behaviour between using Window > Open Perspective and the Perspective Switcher. Steps to repeat: 1. Set "Preferences > General >Perspectives > Open a new perspective > In a new window". 2. Use the Perspective Switcher to open a new perspective. See the new perspective open in the current window. Patch to simply use Workbench#showPerspective() attached. (It also includes a tiny is-null test in closePerspective() to avoid an NPE I was experienced when trying to close a perspective.)
