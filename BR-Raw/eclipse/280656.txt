[ViewMgmt] Sticky views are not working when view has a secondary ID

Build ID: 3.5 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Define a view that allows multiple instances 2. Define the view to be sticky 3. Instantiate an instance of the view with a secondary ID 4. Switch to a different perspective 5. The view does not appear More information: I'm trying to use secondary view ID's in conjunction with sticky views (in Eclipse 3.5). It doesn't work. The problem is that the StickViewManager.update method is calling (on line #116) the Perspective.findView method that provides only the primary view ID. Then the findView method passes secondaryId = null into the other findView method and since the view was registered with a non-null secondary ID the findView method doesn't find it. Please fix this in 3.5.1.
