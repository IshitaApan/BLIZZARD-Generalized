[Wizards] Make WizardNewProjectCreationPage.validatePage protected

I've been using the class WizardNewProjectCreationPage for a while but now I need to add a very simple validation. Looking at the class I just realized I am toasted because there is no way of extending the current validation. Why in an open souce environment, in which we have access to the code and so we can check how much damage we will produce, is there so many private stuff? Another example? FileSystemStructureProvider. Does the contructor really need to be private? I had to copy the whole class just to add a new feature. Note: OK... there is a way of extend the validation on WizardNewProjectCreationPage... I could get all the text controls using ((Composite)getControl()).getChildren() and add my listener but, IMHO, this would be too ugly.
