[Intro] Main Toolbar lost

I200410130800 Almost always when I start Eclipse it comes up with a full screen welcome page. After closing the welcome screen I have a main window without any toolbar. This is really annoying. The only way out is to open a new window but this one decides to place the fast view bar at the bottom again. Furthermore all the UI state of the views are lost.
