[KeyBindings] Do not allow duplicate key bindings

In the new keybinding page you can bind a key to an already used one. i.e. you can bind content assist to ctrl-insert. which is already occupied by copy. There should be at least a warning in some way. Please take the scope into account such that there is an information when changing a binding for a more specific scope.
