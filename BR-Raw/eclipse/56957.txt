[Encoding] Reusable EncodingFieldEditor

I have added the ability to set an encoding for a repository so that commit messages and file names can be properly translated between a client and server whose encodings differ. I have extracted much of the code from IDEEditorsPreferencePage into an EncodingFieldEditor class so I could us it. I was planning on providing a patch to the UI with the hope that this class could be API but there is a roadblock that prevents this. Basically, the encoding preference is in a org.eclipse.core.Preferences node but a field editor requires an IPreferenceStore. There are already two adapters for this is the platform but one is a private inner class of AbstractUIPlugin and the other lives in the text plugin. Instead of creating a patch, I'm just attaching the EncodingFieldEditor class for future consideration.
