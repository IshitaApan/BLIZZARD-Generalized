IDE plugin broken due to missing dependency on runtime compatibility

The dependency upon org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility was removed from org.org.eclipse.core.resources. This breaks our application since org.eclipse.ui.ide depends upon the compatibility plugin for the ResourceNavigator view. The dependency was broken due to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=162402.
