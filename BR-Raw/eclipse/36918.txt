[Working Sets] Add to / Remove from Working Set... Context Menu in Navigator and Package Explorer

Editing working sets in large projects is painful, it would be really handy if there was a context menu in the navigator and package explorer that was something like: Working Set Add to Working Set... (add the current resource to the selected working set) Remove from Working Set (only enabled when you're in a working set)
