ObjectContributionsPerformanceTest not giving useful results

The org.eclipse.ui performance test results for I20050315-1100 are here: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/I20050315-1100/performance/org.eclipse.ui.php? The test results for these tests seem nonsensical: "5000 contribution(s) (Used Java Heap)" -- WinXP "50 contribution(s) (Used Java Heap)" -- Linux GTK+ The Linux test is only running for 5 ms, so it is doing basically nothing, and the heap size results it is reporting do not seem to make much sense. The Windows test is taking a bit longer, but it is strange: 120 ms on 3.1 while it took only 14 ms under 3.0. Furthermore, for the result it is measuring (Used Java Heap), I can't quite tell what it means, nor whether they're useful. Is this test really measuring something in terms of a change in memory?
