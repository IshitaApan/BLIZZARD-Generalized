Very long parameters in selection drop-down for new wizards

I20060919-0010 I was trying to find the New Plug-in Project command in the command composer. I found File -> New but when I go to select the New Wizard parameter, I get complete descriptions of the wizards, each on a single line, as opposed to just the names. Is there any way we can just show the name of the new wizard? See screenshot to follow.
