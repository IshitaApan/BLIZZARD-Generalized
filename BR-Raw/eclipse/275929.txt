[CommonNavigator] IPipelinedTreeContentProvider.getPipelinedElements() not ever called

In a previous change (version 1.18) to NavigatorContentServiceContentProvider, I combined what I thought were identical pipelineElements() and pipelineChildren() methods into a single piplineChildren() method. It turns out there was a difference and the current combined code will never call IPipelinedTreeContentProvider.getPipelinedElements(), which breaks the API. I will provide a patch with the fix shortly. Copied from a comment in bug 255793 A further probing revelaed that there has been changes in the NavigatorContentServiceContentProvider.getElements(Object anInputElement). It used to use pipelineElements(aParentElement, overridingExtensions, localSet) to get the elements from the overridingextensions. This has been replaced with pipelineChildren(aParentElement, overridingExtensions, localSet). To override an extension, a content provider needs to implements org.eclipse.ui.navigator.IPipelinedTreeContentProvider. Our content provider implements getPipelinedElements(Object anInput, Set theCurrentElements) to change the shape of the root element. But becuase of the changes in NavigatorContentServiceContentProvider.getElements(Object anInputElement), this implementation is never being used to get piplined elements. Instead it uses the getPipelinedChildren(Object aParent, Set theCurrentChildren) for getting the pipelined elements. Does this mean that getPipelinedElements(Object anInput, Set theCurrentElements) is now defunctioned and we need to use getPipelinedChildren(Object aParent, Set theCurrentChildren) to change the shape for both root and children elements? With this changes our content provider seems to work fine but am not sure about this.
