[TabbedProperties] Need support for changing color of a tab-label and displaying dynamic images on a tab in Tabbed Properties View

Build Identifier: Latest release / Juno The Eclipse Tabbed Properties Framework does not support tab-decorations i.e. dynamic images on tabs or dynamically changing color of a tab label. Tab labels are always displayed in black-color. An image can be added to a tab using propertyTabs extension in plugin.xml; the image is displayed when the tab is in selected state otherwise it is not displayed. But the image is not dynamic enough because one cannot programatically control whether an image should be displayed or not. This fix can be used to improve usability of tabbed properties UI because tab-decorations can be used to convey, at a glance, information about current state of UI on a tab. The fix should make a provision for possibly setting different number of images for different tabs. Reproducible: Always
