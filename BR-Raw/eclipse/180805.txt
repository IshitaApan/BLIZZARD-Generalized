[Markers] Performance issue when doing 'Select all' in Problems View with large number of warnings

Build ID: I20070323-1616 Steps To Reproduce: We ran across this bug while working with a large workspace. The amount of time spent doing 'Select all' in the problems view is proportional to the total # of warnings/errors. For a large workspace with 46,200 warnings it took 47 seconds, to highlight/select 100 (default visible limit). Here are some other measured times for various # of warnings. #ofWarnings: 4,200 12,600 25,200 46,200 Elapsed Time: 4s 13s 25s 47s The results show about 1s for each 1000 warnings. In the end, we only highlight the 100 visible items, so the response time is expected to be constant. I can provide a generated workspace on request. More information:
