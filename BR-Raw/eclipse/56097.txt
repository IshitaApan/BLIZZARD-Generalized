[RCP] RCP apps should have traditional tabs by default

build I20040324-0800 + latest from HEAD WorkbenchPlugin.initializeDefaultPreferences has been changed to have 		store.setDefault(IPreferenceConstants.SHOW_TRADITIONAL_STYLE_TABS, true); I previously changed it to 		store.setDefault(IPreferenceConstants.SHOW_TRADITIONAL_STYLE_TABS, false); so that RCP apps would get traditional tabs by default. The IDE overrides the default in IDEWorkbenchAdvisor.preStartup.
