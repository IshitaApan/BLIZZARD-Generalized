[Perspectives] Eclipse ignores new filter settings after opening the first time.

I have a plugin which adds a filter extension to the navigator as follows: <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.resourceFilters"> <filter pattern=".foo*" selected="true" /> </extension> If the Eclipse workbench hasn't been opened before (i.e. no workspace metadata), the extension is automatically filtered. However, if there already is metadata, the extension isn't automatically filtered. It seems that once Eclipse has been opened for the first time, the default filter selection is stored in the workbench.xml file in the metadata plugin directory org.eclipse.ui. There needs to be a way to force Eclipse to automatically select my filter extension after the Eclipse workbench has already been opened. The solution must work for both WSB and WSAD. The user should not be forced to manually edit the workbench.xml file to accomplish this.
