[EditorMgmt] missing tooltips in editor dropdown

Hello, I am working on very big C++ project (~20k files). In this project there are many files with the same name but in different locations. These file relate to classes which have the same name but different namespaces. This is very common in this project. For example: Namespace1::Module - src/Namespace1/Module.++ Namespace2::Module - src/Namespace2/Module.++ When opening many files in editor their names are shown if ">>" button is pressed (please see attached screenshot). There is no way to differentiate between files which have the same name, without pressing (choosing) them. Possible solution, if file is focused by cursor its location will be shown as well. This is very important feature for all colleagues in this project. I don't think it is relevant only for C++ but for Java as well (classes with the same name but different packages). I opened it on C++ component but it is probably not correct component. Could you please dispatch it to correct component. Best regards, Yevgeny
