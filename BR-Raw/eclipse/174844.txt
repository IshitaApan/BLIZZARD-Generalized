[JFace] JFace ToolTip class should support manual activation

I have been using the new JFace ToolTip class for showing custom-draw tool tips for my tree items and works very nicely for that. Now I have another context that I need to use tool tips in. In this context, the tool tips need to be activated in response to an event other than mouse movement. To be specific, I want to popup a tool tip when user attempts to uncheck a tree item that shouldn't be unchecked. After the tool tip is displayed, I want standard tooltip behavior (times out, hides on mouse movement, etc.). It doesn't look like I can do that using the ToolTip class. Perhaps a base class can be pulled out from the ToolTip class. The base class would expose a protected show method and let a subclass take care of activation. The existing ToolTip class can then add activation based on mouse movement + delay. Other subclasses can then be made that implement alternative activation methods.
