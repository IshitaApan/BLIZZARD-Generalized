[Properties] Tree editors with columns, using JFace 3.3 infrastructure

Created attachment 91073 sample project with modified tree/columns view Editing support for Trees with columns is a little intense for the user getting into it. Part of this is because JFace has changed the way it handles columns in trees. It would be interesting to look into whether improvements can be made, either - to the default generated tree-with-columns editor to give a better indication of how it is done - provide some infrastructure classes such as an AdapterFactoryTreeColumnsEditor that makes it easier to directly associate features with columns and provide generated cell editors - at least have some sample code to show the "right way" of doing it. Attached is a simple hierarchy model that shows the use of JFace 3.3 TreeViewerColumn and EditingSupport (experts should feel free to correct it).
