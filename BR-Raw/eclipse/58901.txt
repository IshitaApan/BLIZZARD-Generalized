[Commands] [Javadoc] org.eclipse.ui.commands issues

All classes have an assertion about being handle based which offers no functional information. Many are also listed as experimental - this should be removed. Should use deregister rather than unregister. ICategory not detailed enough in description ICategoryListener does not mention how it is used. ICommand should mention what types are in Collections (see getattributeValuesByName, getContextBindings etc) isHandled says return if enabled. Not sure what either mean. ICommandManager has a getActivePlatform and get ActiveLocale. Are these the same as the SWT and java.util ones? Several TODO javadoc No references to types when collections returned ICommandManagerListener is intended to be implemented not may be IContextBinding makes no reference to actual types it binds All javadoc is TODO IHandler give no idea as to what it is - same with IHandlerListener IImageBinding has no javadoc IKeyConfiguration give no idea what defined means
