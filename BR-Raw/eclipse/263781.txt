[GlobalActions] Opening new windows fails with NullPointerException

Created attachment 124803 Two different stack traces Build ID: I20090202-1535 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Choose the menu Window->New Window. 2. Notice that nothing happens. 3. Observe a stack trace in the console (full stack attached): !MESSAGE Failed to update callback: org.eclipse.ui.window.pinEditor !STACK 0 java.lang.NullPointerException at org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.PinEditorHandler.updateElement(PinEditorHandler.java:76) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.handlers.HandlerProxy.updateElement(HandlerProxy.java:431) More information: This also happens when opening new perspectives: if the preference to open perspectives in new windows is set, they fail to appear. This only happens if there is an editor open. This seems to be particular to some set of open views or other preferences. I haven't yet been able to narrow it down to exactly what. I have the Package Explorer and Navigator pulled out into their own window, but closing that didn't solve the issue. I've noticed two slightly different stack traces (attached).
