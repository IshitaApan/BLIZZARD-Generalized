[Wizards] Need to support creating multiple folders at once

It is currently not possible to create more than one folder at a time using the New folder wizard like it is with the import dialogs for instance. We would need to change ResourceAndContainerGroup so that it accepted paths in validateResourceName() and WizardNewFolderPage to build these.
