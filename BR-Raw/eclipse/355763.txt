Provide tag which prohibits a PartStack to collapse when empty

Currently our cleanup addon removes a PartStack when it has no contents anymore for IDEs where Views show only additional informations this makes sense but in RCP-Application one often fakes an none-perspective-shared "editor area" and there it's not making sense to collapse the PartStack. In 3.x API was added in bug 213645 to allow ViewStack to be dureable and if bug 355750 is fixed in 3.8 the ViewStack is even restored on restart. There are 2 things we need to make sure: a) add support to EAP to allow stacks to not collapse when gone empty b) in compat layer we support the durable API
