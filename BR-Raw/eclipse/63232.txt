[Colors/Fonts]  DefaultPartPresentation.init() explicitly sets the font on each tab

I200405200010 The initTab method sets the font on each tab irregardless of the busy state of that tab. Because of this, when our preference listener hears of a font change we're updating the folder but that value doesn't take effect on all tabs because they have explicitly defined fonts.
