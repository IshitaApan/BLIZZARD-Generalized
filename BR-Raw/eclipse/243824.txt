[CommonNavigator] lacks table / tree-table support

SafeDelegateCommonLabelProvider does not allow ITableLabelProvider instances to be used or delegated to. To attempt to use an ITableLabelProvider will have no direct result at all. Even customizing the top level label provider used in the common navigator, making that one an ITableLabelProvider, does nothing because NavigatorContentExtension wraps the instantiated user label provider in a SafeDelegateCommonLabelProvider, which implements many interfaces but not ITableLabelProvider. The solution is to apply this patch to SafeDelegateCommonLabelProvider. At that point, an adopter can customize his Common Viewer's top level label provider to pass things down appropriately. The patch needed is only to SafeDelegateCommonLabelProvider
