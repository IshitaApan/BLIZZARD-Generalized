Platform native icons not used in dialogs

N20040506 For example the 'info' icon for operations in progress, the 'error' icon when an exception occurs, and the 'question' icon when asked to confirm a resource deletion. These used to use the native icons on Windows XP but now they look quite different and non-native. This is a fairly recent regression.
