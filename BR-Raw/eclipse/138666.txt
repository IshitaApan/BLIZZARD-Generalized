[EditorMgmt] provide mechanism for restoring editors without materialization

Currently it seems that editors can only be opened (with or without activation), or get restored via mementos at workbench startup. Mylar, and potentially other tools that need to open more than one editor at once, would benefit from a mechanism to restore editor references identically to how startup does it. Opening a dozen Java editors is unecessarily slow, seems to load the outlines, etc, even when "activate" is set to false. Currently we have: IDE.openEditor(activePage, (IFile) resource, false); What I'm asking for is something like: IDE.openEditors(IWorkbenchPage page, IFile[] files) If no editor was active this would probably want to active the editor for the first file in the list, or could take a boolean to specify if that should happen. It might make sense to try this out somewhere internal before moving it to IDE, but off-hand it seems seperate from the more complicated memento support for restoring editors.
