[ErrorHandling] SafeRunnnableDialog shows only "Reason" as message.

In case of an error the SafeRunner.class will open a SafeRunnnableDialg which (often) only prints String "Reason" and no further information. The reason are a failure in the dialog and and wrong properties-file entry. At end [Line 74] of constructor SafeRunnableDialog(IStatus status) of org.eclipse.jface.util.SafeRunnableDialog.class you will see following code: 		this.message = JFaceResources.format(JFaceResources 				.getString("SafeRunnableDialog_reason"), new Object[] { //$NON-NLS-1$ 				status.getMessage(), reason }); 1.) JFaceResources.format(String key, Object[] args) expects as first parameter a key in a resource bundle, but is already getting the localized value to this key --> leading to MissingResourceException 2.) the properties-value of key "SafeRunnableDialog_reason" in org.eclipse.jface.message.properties = "Reason", but should be "{0} Reason: {1}"
