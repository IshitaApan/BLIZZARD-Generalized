[Compatibility] WorkbenchWindows don't have a default title

In 3.x, workbench windows normally have a default title set to the product name (see WorkbenchWindow#configureShell(Shell) in 3.x). This code appears to have been lost in 4.x, such that windows have a blank title unless one is set by the WorkbenchWindowAdvisor. Steps to repeat: 1. Create a new plug-in project, and select the RCP Mail example. 2. Run the RCP Mail example. 3. See the app window with a blank title.
