[PropertiesView] description of last selected item stays in status line after deselection

Build ID: M20071023-1652 Steps To Reproduce: 1. use a standard java project 2. make sure the package explorer and properties view are open 3. select the "src" folder in the package explorer -> status line shows "project - src" 4. select a random property in the properties view (e.g. "path") -> status line shows "path" 5. select the "JRE System Library" in the package explorer -> status line shows "JRE System Library ... - project" 6. set focus on the (now empty) properties view -> status line shows "path" (should be empty, shouldn't it?) More information: I found this one developing a RCP using PropertyDescriptors and its setDescription(String) method. It's a cosmetic bug, but I think it won't be much work clearing the status line when the properties view looses all content.
