List of Open editors is not in alphabetical order

In Indigo 3.7, the list of open editors contained an alphabeticized list of not visible editors and a bold list of open editors. The alphabeticising was a major assistance when there are more than ten files. This was discussed in Bug 344029. Reopening to avoid confusion with other issues.

I'm unconvinced that the editors are in MRU order. Possibly they're in opening order.

Is rationalized intended to mean take the workaround away? There is now no way to get alphabetical order.
