[WorkbenchLauncher] Can't display progress bar on splash screen

Build ID: I20070209-1006 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a "Hello World" RCP project 2. Brand it as a product with a splash screen 3. Create a SplashHandler as in the attached file SplashHandler.java 4. The progress bar does not appear. More information: I discussed this with Kim Horne on IRC, and she asked me to file it as a bug. It still may just be a dumb user error. I've attached my SplashHandler.java and a sample plug-in using it.
