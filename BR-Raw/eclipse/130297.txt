[Progress] dozens of "Scheduled refresh postponed due to conflicting operations" in Progress view

I20060301-0800 Eclipse suddenly got terribly slow, and tracing revealed that almost 100% of CPU time was burned in layouting the Progress view. Looking there, I found dozens of "Scheduled refresh postponed due to conflicting operations" jobs. I have scheduled a workspace sync every 1 hours.
