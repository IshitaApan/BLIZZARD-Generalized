[Markers] Problems View / Configure Contents dialog should support rename

This is a follow on to bug #257956 which was closed as fixed. The solution was to provide a "Duplicate" button to allow configs to be dup'd then edited. This works ok but it does not remove the need for rename, which was part of the original request. Consider: 1) If I create a new config or duplicate an existing, the only opportunity I get for naming it is at that exact moment. Thereafter, I cannot rename configs that *I* made. So I'm stuck with "New Filter" forever. This makes the name useless in practice. 2) As with the requester of bug #257956, I don't understand the issues around rename of the existing configs, given I can edit all other aspects. More to the point, I can make changes to the config such that it's behaviour *no longer matches* it's description/name. For examples, "Errors/Warnings on Projects" can have the scope changed to be on any element, etc. Thus we've opened the door so the user can make some changes, but not others, resulting in confusion. Because of (1), which creates a situation the user cannot fix except through duplication/deletion, and (2), whereby the user can create a situation of contradiction, this is being logged as a usability bug and not an enhancement.
