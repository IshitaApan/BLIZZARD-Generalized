[Viewers] Please refactor TableLayout to behave like standard layout

TableLayout doesn't follow the expected protocol of a layout. 1. It only lays out once, and ignores subsequent changes in size. 2. Setting a Table to size A followed by size B will result in a different layout than setting it to size C followed by size B. (Layouts should be purely a function of the current size, and should not be affected by previous sizes) 3. If the widget is never given a nonzero size, it will never initialize the column widths. This layout behaves more like a deferred column initializer than a layout, causing bug 86329 in the problems view and bug 41800 in the PDE error view. Both views now contain workarounds, but it would be nice if this extra code was not necessary.
