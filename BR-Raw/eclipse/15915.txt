Import from file system does not create new project

Run eclipse. Pop up menu in navigator. Select import... Select some files. Now what...? You can't select a folder because there are none, and it doesn't offer to create a new project for you. Possible solutions: 1. Provide a way to create the project like several of the other imports do or 2. Don't enable the menu if there are no project to import into
