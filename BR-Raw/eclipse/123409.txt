[FastViews][DnD] Fastview bar is vertically oriented in status bar after switch from 3.1.2 to 3.2

- start M20060109-1200 (3.1.2 candidate) with a new workspace - move the Javadoc and Declaration views to the fast view bar - move the fast view bar to the left - shut down and start I20060110-1026 with the same workspace => The fast view bar is now vertically oriented, but not on the left of the workbench window as expected, but instead in the status bar, making it very high. I found no way to move the fast view bar around or change its orientation.
