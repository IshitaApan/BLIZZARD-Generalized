[Presentations] Outline view tool bar drawn on top of view

I200409140800, GTK+ 2.4.4, KDE 3.3.0, Linux 2.6.8.1 While moving between perspectives, I noticed that the z-order of the components in the Outline had become messed up. I'm not sure if this is reproducible. STEPS: 1.) Open WorkbenchWindow (with changes) in the Java perspective. 2.) Switch to the Team Synchronizing perspective. 3.) Open a compare editor on WorkbenchWindow. 4.) Switch back to the Java perspective. 5.) Switch back to the WorkbenchWindow Java editor.
