Part service does not autogenerate stacks if the last container is not one

Build: I20101029 Eric notes in bug 303778 that: > We should also consider what we want to do for 'stand alone' views (i.e. I mean > MParts that are not children of an MPartStack). Currently (even in 3.x) we have > no place to show the Toolbar/Menu (or even the close button). I use a variant of the Java Browsing perspective where I embed the projects/packages/types/methods views as standalone views (maximizing real estate density). This perspective comes up fine under the e4 compatibility layer. Unfortunately all other new views added are also added as standalone views! The code is available through a p2 repo/update site at: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/eclipse-tools/ specifically as the "Eclipse Hacks" feature. The actual source is in src/bsd/eh/StrippedJavaBrowsingPageLayout.java, shipped as part of the bundle at: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/eclipse-tools/plugins/bsd.eh_0.0.6.jar
