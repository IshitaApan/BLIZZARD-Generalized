Ctrl+A (select all) is not applied to the (right) focused area

Build Identifier: I20110518-2200 it might be same as this bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=323706 that is, if that one gets fixed maybe this one will too. But check this first: Basically Ctrl+A should select the text in the current text area but it doesn't, instead something unfocused in another window gets selected. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. get a detached Problems view, ie. Window->Show View->Problems, right click on its title tab and Detached (ok this doesn't exist in e4? it's only Close, then I don't know how you detach it in e4 but since I already used settings and workspace from a 3.7 eclipse it remained detached) 2. make sure Errors and/or Warnings have children and they are expanded (at least 1 child should be visible, else if none expanded this won't work) 3. click inside the editor (inside a java file) OR click on a file in Package Explorer (Ctrl+A will have effect here) 4. click in Problems view directly on any child (or even the parent) 5. now click on Window->Preferences, you should be focused on the Filter text , you can enter some text(preferably) and/or just press Ctrl+A there, this won't select the entered text, this will in fact apply Ctrl+A in the editor, or in package explorer (depending which one was last focused before you clicked on a child in Problems View)
