[Workbench] command line args not accepted

build i-2002-10-23, win2K, j9 & ibm JRE 1.3.1 The "-showlocation" command-line argument will not work with a mixture in case due to code in the WorkbenchWindow constructor which does an equals() instead of an equalsIgnoreCase(). When checking against any command-line arguments, we need to ignore the case. (not sure if there is code which checks for -data, and others)
