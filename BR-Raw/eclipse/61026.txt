Adding a New Extension Site

M8 and around there you could use the product config dialog to add an extension site. It required the .eclipseextnsion file in the eclipse dir (or we were warned that it would be soon). All fine. I just grabbed 0504 and tried the above. I had been browsing to my target dir: d:\mystuff\eclipse and saying go. This no longer works in 0504. I have to browse to d:\mystuff instead. I remember text flying by that said if we forgot the \eclipse on the command API that you would add it. But I did not take that to mean that we could not add it ourselves (at least in the UI). If both d:\mystuff\eclipse and d:\mystuff are accepted (assuming that \eclipse\.eclipseextension exists) that is fine. But seems wrong that you started to refuse d:\mystuff\eclipse.
