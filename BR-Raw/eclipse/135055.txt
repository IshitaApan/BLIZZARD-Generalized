Save action state is not refreshed when Properties View is active for a selection in Common Navigator

The Properties View now delegates the save behavior to the source of the properties instead of the active editor. Its initial state is ok. However, if there is an active editor that is not dirty but Properties View is displayed for selection in Common Navigator that represents another (dirty) model then Save is properly enabled. And if the user hits CTRL+S it actually works fine: the model is saved and Common Navigator labels (model itself and title bar) are properly updated but the Save action itself does not change the state - it is still enabled. Similarly, if the initial selection is in a non-dirty model, the Save action is disabled, then make change through the Properties View and you can see the labels in Common Navigator being updated but Save action does not get enabled. It does if the element is re-selected in Common Navigator.
