[Encoding] Wrong information shown in encoding properties dialog

I200411040010 Found when verifying bug 74529 which is marked verified for M3. Marking a major since wrong and misleading information is shown in the UI. Open the encoding properties of a *.java file. It says: determined from content. This is wrong: the encoding gets inherited from the container. To test simply change the container's encoding and open the properties again ==> the encoding of the Java file now shows the one of the parent. If it would be determined from the content it would not have changed. Maybe the information comes from the fact that there's a content type definition (but it does not define a default encoding) for *.java? Similar issue for properties files: the encoding is not exactly determined from the content (as it is with XML files or when a BOM is detected). Instead the encoding is the default encoding for the given content type.
