[Properties view] Querying nonexistent project for properties causes NPE

When Eclipse is started and some resources in the navigator views cannot be found (e.g. the .project file), the project in which this resource resides is automatically closed. However, when this project's properties are requested (e.g. to show them in the properties view), a NullPointerException occurs when requesting the read-only attribute of the project: after fetching the IFileInfo object of the resource, an existence check is performed in FileSystemResourceManager#attributes(IResource). When the resource does not exist, null is returned, provoking a NPE in ResourcePropertySource#getPropertyValue(Object). As the general contract of IResource#getResourceAttributes() states that null must be returned if the attributes could not be obtained, invokers must perform a null check. This means there are two bugs: - The filesystem is contacted to display project properties for closed projects (see also bug 151089). - If, for some reason or other, resource properties cannot be retrieved, a null check is missing.
