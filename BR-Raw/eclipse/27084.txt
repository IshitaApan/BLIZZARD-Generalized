[View Mgmt] Add notification of view becoming hidden / visible

build I20021119 Several people have requested the ability to avoid updating a view when it is hidden, then bringing it up to date when made visible. At the SWT level, there is no callback to notify when a control has become hidden or visible (other than the paint callback). Control.isVisible() only tells you whether the control and all its parents have been set to be visible, not whether it is obscured. However, at the Workbench level, we know when a view is visible. We know: - whether it is a regular view, not in a tab folder, - whether it is frontmost in a tab folder - whether it is the active fast view - whether it is obscured by a zoomed view or editor We should investigate adding an IPartListener2 interface with partHidden and partVisible methods. Below is a representatitve request for this feature, from boxall@ca.ibm.com: I would like to raise this topic again because we still need to have a solution for debug engines that have many local variables, (in the thousands) Since making the last append I added code that watches for the closing of the variables view. This allows me to tell the connected debug engine to stop monitoring locals when the user closes the variable view. This doesn't really solve the problem. What I really want is notification when the variables view is hidden so that I have the opportunity to disable/suppress local variable monitoring until the variables view becomes visiable again. I can't use the "IPartListener.partDeactivated()" message because just the act of giving another view focus (not hiding the variables view) will create this event. The user still expects the variables view to update as long as it is visible.
