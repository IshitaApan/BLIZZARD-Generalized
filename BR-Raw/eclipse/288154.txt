[perfs] Comments applied for performance tests may be obsolete

Looking at code in HEAD today, I can see several performance tests referencing the Performance.setComment(...) method: 1) LayoutTest.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=129001>See Bug 129001</a>" Looking at bug 129001, it seems that everything is done (and it should have been set as FIXED), hence this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 2) ObjectContributionsPerformance.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=270795>See Bug 270795</a>" Bug 270795 was fixed in 3.5, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 3) OpenCloseWindowTest.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=179725>See Bug 179725</a>" Bug 179725 was not fixed but the regression occurred between 3.2 and 3.3, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 4) OpenMultipleEditorTest.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=270797>See Bug 270797</a>" Bug 270797 was fixed in 3.5, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 5) PerspectiveSwitchTest.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=179581>See Bug 179581</a>" Bug 179581 was not fixed but the regression occurred between 3.2 and 3.3, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 6) PresentationActivePartPropertyTest.runTest(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101072>See Bug 101072</a>" Bug 101072 was not fixed but the regression occurred between 3.0 and 3.1, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 7) TreeAddTest.testAddHundred(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101853>See Bug 101853</a>" Bug 101853 was not fixed but the regression occurred between 3.0 and 3.1, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 8) CollatorPerformanceTest.testCollator(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=275170>See Bug 275170</a>" Bug 275170 was fixed in 3.5, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 9) ComboViewerRefreshTest.testRefresh(): 10) ComboViewerRefreshTest.testRefreshSmall(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=98265>See Bug 98265</a>" Bug 98265 was fixed in 3.2, so this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests. 11) ListViewerRefreshTest.testRefresh(): The comment says: "<a href=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=99022>See Bug 99022</a>" Bug 99022 was closed as WONTFIX in 3.1, so the regression which occurred between 3.0 and 3.1 should no longer been noticeable, hence this comment should be removed for 3.6 performance tests.
