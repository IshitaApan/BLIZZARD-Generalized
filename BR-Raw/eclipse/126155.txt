[Markers] Issues of multi quick fix dialog

I20060131-1200 Here are a few things to improve in the multi quickfix dialog (problems view -> Quick fix on a missing SUID problem) - Description of the dialog ("Select the fix for...") should put the problem message in quotes to make it more readable. - What about an icon in the title area? We have not other dialogs like this which do not show an icon in the title area. - Either use "resolution" or "fix" as term for the offered proposal. I'd suggest to use fix (e.g. in "Select a resolution:") - Perhaps "Add Matching Problems" is not that clear. It is more something like searching for similar problems which can be fixed the same way, e.g. "Find similar problems" - The progress message which appears when clicking on "Add Matching Problems" ("Calculating Possible Resolutions working on...") should better rephrased to "Searching for similar problems..." - After having clicked on "Add Matching Problems", this button gets disabled. As soon as the selection is changed, it is reenabled again. I suggest to enable this button once for a specific fix to let the user find similar problems, and cache the results.
