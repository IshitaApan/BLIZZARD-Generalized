[EditorMgmt] MultiEditor: does not support propagate events

As found by Nikolay Botev while trying to implement split editor functionality using the idea from bug 8009 comment 112: 1. "File > Save" works but invokes Save command twice 2. "File > Save As..." does not work 3. Making a change in the editor does not mark editor tab as dirty (no "*")
