[QuickAccess] Regression: "Quick access" panel lacks major usability features from 3.x stream

Build Identifier: Build id: I20111028-1100 AS IS: 1) Start to type into "Quick access" area. A table with possible matches will appear. It is usually too narrow, so you have to resize it to see the content. Unfortunately, the new size is not remembered, so you have to do it each and every time. 2) Start to type into "Quick access" area. A table with possible matches will appear. It is opened ALWAYS as a small box on the right side of the window. User can NOT move it to any other location. On large screens, it should appear *centered*, or at least allow to move it and remember the position after moving for the next time. 3) There is no "Previous choices" in the "Quick access" area. In 3.8, after pressing <Ctrl+3>, "Previous choices" was shown in the "Quick access" area, letting user quickly select most recently used view/command. Now there is NO such feature anymore. 4) Type <Ctrl+Space> into "Quick access" area (this was my natural attempt to workaround issue 3). You would now expect kind of content assist, showing "Previous choices". Nope. Nothing happens. Even worse, if at the same time a Java editor is active, it will show you *Java editor* content assist. This is simply a bug. TO BE: Please give either the old "Quick assist" view back or provide all of its features on the new one. Reproducible: Always
