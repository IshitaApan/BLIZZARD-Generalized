Remove timestamp check for the base application model

As a part of startup we compare timestamps on the last saved UI model (workbench.xmi) and the base application model (LegacyIDE.e4xmi for Eclipse IDE). Whichever one is more recent gets used to create the UI. We did not realize that Git does not preserve time stamps which makes this comparison invalid (see bug 380663). Moreover, until M7, the problem was masked by another bug (bug 377798) which effectively made Eclipse always use "workbench.xmi" file if it was present. For 4.2 (and probably for 4.2.1) it will be better to retain this behavior (always use "workbench.xmi") as it will result in expected behavior for IDE users, which is the primary target for the 4.2 release. (For 4.3 we'll need to consider either adding explicit versions to the application models or keeping hashes of their contents.)
