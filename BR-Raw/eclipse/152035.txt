[BiDi] Menu items do not appear for IFile resources when -nl iw is used

I found an very weird problem that only seems to appear in Eclipse 3.2.1 when the language setting is set to -nl iw. A drop down menu item seems to be missing when -nl iw is specified. If just english is specified the menu item appear as expected. This problem does not occur in Eclipse 3.2. - To reproduce this problem do the following: - Download a 3.2.1 driver. I downloaded eclipse-SDK-M20060726-0800-win32.zip. - Overlay on top of this driver a WTP driver. I used http://download3.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/drops/R1.5/M-1.5.1-200607211907/ - Start eclipse in a new workspace WITHOUT the -nl iw command line flag. - Create a Java project. - Create some Class in the source directory of this Java project. - Switch to the resource perspective. - If you right click on the java file a menu item called "Web Services" will appear. - shutdown eclipse. - Start eclipse with the "-nl iw" language flag. - In the resource perspective again right click on the java file.(Note: being in the resource perspective is important to reproducing this bug) - The "Web Services" menu item will be missing. Note: if Eclipse 3.2 is used as the base driver this problem does not occur.
