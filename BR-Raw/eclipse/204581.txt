[Preferences] Filtered tree doesn't update font and size

I20070921-0919. FilteredPreferenceDialog.updateTreeFont(Font) is called when the font changes. This method calls: FilteredPreferenceDialog.updateTreeFont(Font) which only updates the font when the widget doesn't have a(ny) font set. If a dialog font has already been set then this method does nothing. Test Case: 1. open 'Colors and Fonts' pref page 2. change dialog font to something else 3. click 'Apply' ==> font is changed (but entry field size wrong) 4. change dialog font a second time 5. click 'Apply' ==> tree not updated.
