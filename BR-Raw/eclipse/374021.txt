[Compatibility] Window > New Window from window with no perspective fails

1. Create a product with no default perspective; configure various actions include Window > New Window 2. Start the product: should open to an empty window with the Welcome/Intro 3. Choose Window > New Window The action will fail with a dialog saying: Problems Opening New Window: Unable to create perspective 'null'. There is no corresponding perspective extension. Although this is a bit of a useless app, it could be typical for a platform shell (a base product where all functionality is to be installed somehow). In our discussion on March 8, 2012, there was consensus that allowing no-perspective is supposed to be supported. The problem is in Workbench#openWorkbenchWindow() has guard code checking for a null perspective. This guard is erroneous given the javadoc for IWorkbench#openWorkbenchWindow() says that the perspectiveId can be null for an empty page.
