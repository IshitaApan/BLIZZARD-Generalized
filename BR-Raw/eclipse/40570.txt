[Dialogs] New Project wizard throws NPE with two backslashes

Matt Clement (mattclem@us.ibm.com), 919-254-5681 Problem: Typing two backslash characters in the project name field of the new Java project wizard causes a NPE for the 2nd slash and an additional NPE for each slash after that. Scenario: -Create a Simple Project by invoking the wizard. File->New->Project;Simple->Project->Next -In the project name field type two backslashes Expected Results: An error message occurs with no adverse side effects. Actual Results: An error message does occur after the first slash but after the 2nd slash an NPE is written to the .log file. Remarks: For each additional slash typed after the 2nd one an additional NPE is written. Probably just an escape sequence problem or something of that nature. An easy way to see this is to make sure to have the PDE Runtime view up and on top when trying to reproduce the error and the exception wlil pop up as soon as the 2nd slash is typed.
