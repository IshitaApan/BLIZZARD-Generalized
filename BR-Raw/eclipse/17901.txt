Switching direction from forward to backward in find/replace results in loop

If I do one of the two the following things on a simple text file editor, eclipse begins to loop and can only be terminated by brute force (using F1): a) Replace a String in the editor using "Replace All" until the end of the file in the forward direction. In the dialog, the "Find" value will switch to the "Replace with" value. Then switch to backward direction, and "Replace All" again -> Eclipse begins to loop b) Simular to a). Search a value "hello" and replace by "_hello". After "Replace All" in forward direction, change the "Find" value in the dialog to the original value again, while the last found value is still selected. Then switch to backward direction again. After "Replace All", the following happens: _hello -> __hello -> ...... -> ________________________hello and so on. The search occurs again and again on the last found value.
