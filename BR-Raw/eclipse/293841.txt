[FieldAssist] NumLock keyDown event should not close the proposal popup [with patch]

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 Build Identifier: 20090920-1017 I have a Text widget with a ContentProposalAdapter attached to it. The user shall input some numeric value, but on this platform (Windows 2003 Terminal Server with rdestop unix client, if that matters) there are additional keyDown events generated for num pad input. These events almost immediately close the proposal popup after user input. Input with the normal "digit keys" works as expected. The ContentProposalAdapter.ControlProposalPopup.TargetControlListener class currently does check for keyDown events on the SWT.CAPS_LOCK and SWT.MOD{1-4} keys and does ignore them. Any other key forces the popup to close. I suggest to also NOT close the popup on SWT.NUM_LOCK keyDown events. Reproducible: Always
