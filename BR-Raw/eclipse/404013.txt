Regression to 4.2.1: Cancel button for window progress bar is gone!

4.2.2 and M6. Works in 4.2.1. The cancel button for the window progress bar is gone! This means, one can no longer cancel long-running jobs and has to wait until it is finished. In very bad scenarios, one has to kill the IDE. NOTE: You need to test on a fresh workspace. In older workspaces the button might appear.
