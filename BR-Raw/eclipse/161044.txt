[Import/Export] Error: Destination directory conflicts with location of workspace root

Steps to reproduce: 1)Create a new simple project called Proj1 2)Create a new simple project called Proj2 3)Create a new file called testFile in Proj1 4)Try to export the testFile as a zip file and put that zip file inside C:\<yourWorkspace>\Proj2 You get error "Destination directory conflicts with location of workspace root" The code causing this is in UI. The class is called org.eclipse.ui.internal.wizards.datatransfer.WizardFileSystemResourceExportPage1and the method is #validateDestinationGroup. - Why is this considered an error? Products built upon Eclipse allow you to export to a directory in the workspace so obviously this is not a rule but more of a policy used by Eclipse export wizard. This introduces inconsistent behaviour with downstream products. - Can the export be made less restrictive? For example, permit the above example but prevent exports that would damage or corrupt the workspace.
