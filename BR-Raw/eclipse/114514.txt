[WorkingSets] Need API to detect whether a working set provide an updater or not

I20051101-0010 During M3 test pass we dicovered scenarios where the package explorer gets into an inconsistent state when using working sets different than the Java or resource working set. The problem is that the package explorer relies on the existence of an updater class for the working set. However not all working sets need to have one. Enclosed an patch that adds additional API. Since Aggregate working sets must be handled special I have added API to check this as well. For M3 I will fix the problem in JDT/UI be referring to internal API. Something like this. WorkingSetRegistry registry = WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getWorkingSetRegistry(); String workingSetId= set.getId(); if (workingSetId == null) return false; WorkingSetDescriptor descriptor= registry.getWorkingSetDescriptor(workingSetId); if (descriptor == null || descriptor.getUpdaterClassName() == null) return false; Can the API be added for M4 ?
