[Viewers] API: need to add methods to StructuredViewer to support ViewerComparator

ViewerComparator was added as a superclass of ViewerSorter before the API freeze to accommodate JFace consumers that want to take advantage of using ICU4J in StructuredViewers. We had to do this because ViewerSorter#getCollator() returns a java.text.Collator. The Collator class is re-implemented in ICU4J but since Collator is in the method signature we cannot change this to use an ICU collator. The ViewerComparator#getComparator() allows consumers to use a com.ibm.icu.Collator. Unfortunately, in all this we overlooked the fact that 	StructuredViewer.setSorter(ViewerSorter) does not allow users to set the viewer’s sorter to use a ViewerComparator (since it is a superclass not a subclass of ViewerSorter) which means that ICU4J cannot be used in sorters of StructuredViewers. This was purely an oversight. We propose adding 2 methods to StructuredViewer 	public void setComparator(ViewerComparator) 	public ViewerComparator getComparator() to enable clients to take advantage of using ICU4J in their StructuredViewers. We would also be deprecating the methods 	public ViewerSorter StructuredViewer.getSorter() 	public void StructuredViewer.setSorter(ViewerSorter) to encourage clients to adopt ICU4J, or at least use consistent API if they do not want to utilize ICU4J. In order to ensure we don’t break downstream users we need to: 1. ensure clients know how to properly use the API i.e. javadoc the get/setSorter and get/setComparator methods such that users know not to mix usage of the comparator and sorter get/set methods. 2. ensure any StructuredViewers the platform creates and exposes in their API (IResource Navigator.getViewer() as one example) are changed to use the new get/setComparator APIs and that consumers of these viewers use getComparator(), not getSorter(). We will need Michael Elder to check if there are any similar occurrences in the common navigator framework. Also see bug 120463 (comment 10). I will attach the patch that has the API/javadoc changes to StructuredViewer.
