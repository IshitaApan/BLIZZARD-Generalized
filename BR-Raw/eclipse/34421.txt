[Encodings] Encodings inconsistent between pref and editor

RC1 build I20030307 The list of encodings in the Workbench / Editors pref page is: Cp1252 ISO-8859-1 US-ASCII UTF-16 UTF-16BE UTF-16LE UTF-8 The Edit/Encoding menu has: Cp1252 (Default) ASCII Latin 1 UTF-8 UTF-16 (big endian) UTF-16 (little endian) UTF-16 The pref uses the machine-readable encoding names. It would be better to use human-readable names like the Edit/Encoding menu Cp1252 is the default here, and may differ in other locales. The combo in the pref does not indicate (Default) like the Edit menu does. We should also add more default encodings.
