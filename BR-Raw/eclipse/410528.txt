[CommonNavigator] ProjectExplorer should use its viewer's label provider to build its content description

Currently, ProjectExplorer.updateTitle() sets the part's content description (which is displayed at the top of the view's tree whenever the user uses the "Go Into" context command to change the tree's root) by first attempting to adapt the viewer's input to IWorkbenchAdapter and using that adapter to build a label. The resulting label is used for the content description. If this is not successful, the content description is simply set to the result of calling toString() on the input. It seems like the appropriate way to build the content description would be to use the already available label provider; especially since it seems the purpose of IWorkbenchAdapter is to be used by a "universal" label provider, not directly by the Viewer.
