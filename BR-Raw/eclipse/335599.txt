[Compatibility] 'launcher' attribute for editor extensions are not considered

Using eclipse.buildId=I20110126-2200 java.version=1.6.0_24 java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc. BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86_64, WS=win32, NL=fr_CA Command-line arguments: -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86_64 -console, I tried to select a xml file that I produced by exporting JUnit tests results. I saved that file inside a simple project (jdt) inside my workspace. I selected the file and tried "Right-Click">Open with>JUnit view. I got an error about: Executable extension definition for "class" not found. And: Unable to create part The log contents is: !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2011-01-27 13:34:10.159 !MESSAGE Unable to create part !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 1 2011-01-27 13:34:10.160 !MESSAGE Executable extension definition for "class" not found. I am using a 4.1 build. So this might be a problem only with 4.1.
