[Editor Mgmt] Show file name in title bar

RC1 Due to tab compression, it is sometimes hard to see the name of the file being edited. We should show the current editor's file name in the titlebar. Some issues: A) Should we show the simple name or the full path? I think we should just show the simple name since there's too much other info in the titlebar for a full path: page input, current perspective, product name, workspace path. B) Should the file name be shown when there is a page input. For example, if you open hierarchies in new windows, should it show the type name that the window was opened on, the file name, or both? If both, in what order? I never work in this mode, so my position is the naive one: [editorInput -] [pageInput -] [currentPerspective -] productName [- workspaceLocation] Simon and Eduardo, what do you think? Erich, can you gather opinions for ZRH folk?
