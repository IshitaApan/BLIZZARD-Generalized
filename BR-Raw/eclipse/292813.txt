[CommonNavigator] Please provide an API for enabling and disabling common navigator filters programmatically

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.27 Safari/532.0 Build Identifier: M20090917-0800 Recently I had a case where I wanted to enable/disable a common navigator filter from code and found it very difficult. I basically ended up using the code in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.filters.UpdateActiveFiltersOperation as a reference and ended up manually creating or pruning an array, as well as adding/removing a corresponding ViewerFilter to/from and refreshing the underlying viewer. This seems quite complicated and I think others could benefit from it being API similar to how API was recently added to enable and disable content contributions (via INavigatorContentService#activateExtensions and INavigatorContentService#deactivateExtensions). Reproducible: Always
