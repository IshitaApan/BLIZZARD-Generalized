[Dialogs] wizard banner resizing causes jumpy dialog

Build: I20041214-2000 3.1 M4 test pass. The Export wizard selection page has a banner description at the top. For some wizards this description is two lines, and for others it is one line. This causes the entire dialog to resize every time you change the selection. The effect is that the item under the mouse after the click isn't the same as the item under the mouse before the click, since the entire list shifts up or down as the banner resizes. This doesn't happen on Windows.
