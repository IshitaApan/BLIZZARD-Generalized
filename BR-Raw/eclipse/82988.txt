[Import/Export] Importing Existing Projects should support Archive Files

Importing from Archive File and from File System should include options for importing as projects (similar to CVS). I've constructed a patch to do so, I've completed the najor functionality for Archive File (File System isn't done yet but should be very easy since it should be almost identical) but I'm running into some difficulties regarding the UI, as you can see the radio button for selecting an existing folder is not next to the text field and button which specify the folder, this is because these components are in WizardResourceImportPage which I can't really alter. The only options I can think of are to make them protected instead of private (did that a few times already) and start pulling out some components so I can stuff my radio button in there too. I'll attach the patch I have so far, ignore the "File System" section as that's going to be redone when I figgure out the solution, "Archive File" is the part I've been working on. I'm looking for opinions anyone may have on the current functionality and how to fix this UI issue. thanks
