[Workbench] Tool bar buttons require mouse focus to get read using MSAA

20030730 When you cycle through buttons using the mouse the tooltip value will not be given to the MSAA interface. If you select using a mouse it will. STEPS 1) Start up Inspect Objects 2) Tab through Eclipse until you get focus on a tool bar button. There will be no name or value 3) Move the button over with the mouse - you will get tool tip text
