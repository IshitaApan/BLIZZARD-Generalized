[Dialogs] Title Area dialog should support > 2 lines text

The Update dialog message is too long on Linux. The TitleAreaDialog is designed to have 2 lines of text and this dialog has 3 so the top and bottom get cut off. There is also a missing period and the end of the last sentence. STEPS 1) Install the examples to your eclipse install 2) Restart Eclipse - look at the message in the dialog.
