[DataBinding] Unexpected behavior from BindSpec converter and validator setters

The set methods that accept one validator/converter don't behave as expected. For example if setValidators(...) was called with 2 validators and then setValidator(...) was called it would only change the first validator stored internally. The validator that previously was set at index 1 in the array is still maintained by BindSpec. Also the setValidator(...) method always assumes that an array with at least a length of 1 exists. If setValidators(...) is called with an array of length zero and then a call is made to setValidator(...) an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. Same problems would occur with setting it to null except of course a NPE will be thrown. When I get some time I'll try to apply a patch for this. The changes that I'll make will be that when any set is called it removes all previous values.
