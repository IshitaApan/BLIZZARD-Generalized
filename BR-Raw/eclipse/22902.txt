[Navigator] F5 and Ctrl+F5 both refresh

Moji Trasti brought to my attention that some of the shortcuts that are documented at: http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-ui- home/accessibility/keys.html don't work. To quote her "In particular I had question about Ctrl-E and Ctrl-Shift-E function. I'm not sure what function it should have. Eclipse Docs have it listed as erase line, but the WebReview has it listed as Search Next. On my build, it isn't doing either one. Let me know if you have more up-to-date links than I have." I take information for the Accessibility documentation for WebSphere Studio from this table and that is the review she refers to above ("Next problem" was the previous function listed in that table for Ctrl+E before the table was updated last month. I also found that Ctrl+B used to be Project > Build All, but now there is no entry in the table for that. I require this information as soon as possible as our doc Freeze date is tomorrow (08/28/2002).
