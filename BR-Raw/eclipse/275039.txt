[Markers] Configure contents "Match all/any configuration" wording ambiguous

Created attachment 134480 Mockup showing alternative wording 3.5M7 On the markers Configure Contents dialog, I wasn't sure what the radio buttons "Match all configurations"/"Match any configurations" did. I thought it might affect what was shown on the right hand side. What it it fact means is that results must match either all checked configs or any checked configs. I think my confusion was that I didn't know the context of "match all configurations" --- match where? On the right hand side of the dialog? I'd suggest an alternative wording (see mockup).
