[Forms] Expandable Composite right margin computation bug

Build ID: I20070222-0951 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Make a form with a section 2.Add controls to the form More information: I noticed there was (marginWidth + thmargin) less to what should be the section's client width. I compared what i get to the screen shots in "UI Forms enhancements in release 3.3" (yes i did that! :)) and found that i add a two big margin on the right. I debugged the private layout of ExpandableComposite and i found that at line 332 (in release 3.3M5) int areaWidth = clientArea.width - marginWidth - marginWidth 	- thmargin - thmargin; int cx = marginWidth + thmargin; if ((expansionStyle & CLIENT_INDENT) != 0) { 	cx = x; 	areaWidth -= x; } But when that is called x equals to (marginWidth + thmargin) so after that areaWidth equals to clientArea.width - 3*marginWidth - 3*thmargin. Is that a bug or a feature ? If it is a bug then i propose the following: int areaWidth = clientArea.width - marginWidth - thmargin; int cx = marginWidth + thmargin; if ((expansionStyle & CLIENT_INDENT) != 0) { 	cx = x; } areaWidth -= cx;
