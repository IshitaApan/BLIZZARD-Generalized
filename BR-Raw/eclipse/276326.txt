[target] Target resolution when editing targets

It seems that every time a Target is edited in the preference pages there is a long (multi minute) delay while "Resolving Target Contents". It appears that several repos are being downloaded (you can see contents.jar being downloaded) and the progress seems to say that various things are being "installed". That part goes by quickly but looks like these are platform-specific fragments or some such. Note that this seems to happen similarly when opening the target editor. - p2 should be already caching and updating the repos as needed so redownloading every time the target it edited should not be needed. - The profile has all the goodies in it for the user to edit so we should not need the remote repo at all unless the user wants to add more stuff from that particular site. In general users will expect the workflows and behaviours here to be similar to that of the Install Software experience. There you can open the current profile and poke around pretty much without delay. Repos are updated as needed and loaded in the background.
