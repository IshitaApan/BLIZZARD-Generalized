[ErrorHandling] Error dialog has wrong parent when modal shell is up

I20080429-0100, WinXP Sorry if this is a dup, I didn't see it. Also wondering if this is a regression. If you use StatusManager.getManager().handle(status, StatusManager.SHOW); while a modal dialog is up, it is not parented correctly. The dialog pops up in your face but you can't touch it unless you first dismiss the modal dialog. This is pretty bad because often the user doesn't see the error, or worse, doesn't realize why they can't interact with it. This exchange is copied from bug #229331 (where p2 has a similar problem with its own dialog) >>Tod, I know you get asked this every day, but what's the magic spell to obtain >>an appropriate parent shell when opening a dialog? This is the standard "prompt >>dialog behind a modal dialog" problem. >See ProgressManagerUtil. It is not currently API but the pattern is pretty >straightforward
