Working Set icon displayed as red square

There seems to be a problem with the working set icon: a red square is shown instead of the icon. Note: 1) since it is now read it picks up the icon declaration 2) the icon (path) I use is copied from another icon declaration where the icon shows up Therefore I assume there's a problem in the code which picks up the icon. My working set declaration is: <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.workingSets"> 	<workingSet 		id="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaWorkingSetPage" 		name="%JavaWorkingSetPage.name" 		icon="icons/full/obj16/jcu_obj.gif" 		pageClass="org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.workingsets.JavaWorkingSetPage"> 	</workingSet> </extension>
