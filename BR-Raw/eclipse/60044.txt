[EditorMgmt] Opening the editor tab's system menu restores all open editors?

0) preference settings: - editors>show multiple editor tabs unchecked - close all editors on exit unchecked 1) open many editors 2) shut down and restare 3) open the system menu on the editor tab ->it takes a long time before the context menu shows up. I happend to have 30 editors open and took about 30 seconds. The problem is that opening the context menu restores all open editors. The culprit seems to be SystemMenuCloseOtherEditors.update() public void update() { 	if (editorPane == null) { 		setEnabled(false); 		return; 	} >>> 	setEnabled(editorPane.getPage().getEditors().length > 1); } Notice the call to getEditors() which will result in restoring all editors. The call should probably be replaced by getEditorReferences()
