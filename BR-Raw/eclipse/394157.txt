[EditorMgmt] List of CTRL+F6 editors is no longer is "most recently used" order

Version: Eclipse SDK 4.2.2.M20121107-1200 Steps to reproduce: 1. Open editors for resources A, B, and C (in this order) 2. Hold CTRL, press F6: The list of editors is [A, B, C] It should be [C, B, A], because C has been used last. Also, when switching editors, the list is not updated. As a result, CTRL+F6 will always switch to editor B. It seems that the CTRL+F6 list is in the same order as the tabs. When I drag the tab of editor C to the very left, the list changes to [C, A, B]. This behaviour defeats the point of CTRL+F6: with that short cut, I used to be able to switch to the previously (second-last, ...) used editor. I hope you agree that the current behaviour is a regression and that the MRU behaviour needs to be restored.
