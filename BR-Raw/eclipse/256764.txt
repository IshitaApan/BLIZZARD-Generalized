[Viewers] Does DecoratingStyledCellLabelProvider add/remove the correct listener to/from the decorator

Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: Add multiple ILabelProviderListeners to a DecoratingStyledCellLabelProvider and remove one of them. Now the decoration does not work anymore. More information: In the methods addListener and removeListener, the internal labelProviderListener is added/removed to/from the decorator. Maybe this should be the listener that comes as parameter.
