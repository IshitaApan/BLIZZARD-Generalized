[Workbench] Editor/View tab behaviour wrong.

Windows 2003 Eclipse M9 eclipse.buildId=I200405211200. Since M9 editor and view tab behaviour is different and counter intuitive. First most recently opened editor is always positioned to be leftmost tab, instead of rightmost tab (like any other application). Also, when restarting Eclipse most recently used editor tab is placed to be leftmost (this becomes irrelevant if single editor option is used). The second extremely annoying "feature" is that view tabs are repositioned. If one switched from Java to Debug and then to Java perspective again, the most recently active tab in Java perspective becomes the leftmost view tab. If one switches between perspectives and views a lot, then view placement (ordering) becomes almost random. This is simply too annoying to be useful. I'm so used to having my views ordered in a certain way and I automatically go with my mouse there only to find out that my view has magically wondered off somewhere else. OT: Another example of such bad UI (i.e. UI that constantly changes) is the windows 2000 and later feature to only display the menu options that are most often used. Luckily that option can be turned off in windows.
