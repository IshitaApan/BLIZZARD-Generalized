[KeyBindings] Key bindings not updated properly in PDE editors

Build I20040428 + 1) Edit plugin.xml of org.eclipse.ui and uncomment the new manifest editor that is commented out. 2) Create a Hello, World plug-in, close the editor and open it with a new (uncommented) plug-in editor. 3) Switch to plugin.xml page 4) Switch to Dependencies page. Select one of the listed plug-ins 5) Press 'Delete'. Notice how nothing happens, the editor becomes dirty. Switch to source page and notice how '<' from the first character got deleted. Add it. 6) Switch back to Dependencies. Select the plug-in again but this time select Edit>Delete from the menu. Observe how the element gets deleted this time. It appears that when global action bar contributors are updated and refreshed during page switching, key bindings are not. If you don't want to play with CVS and uncommenting, wait for the morning I20040504 build - all the PDE editors will be in. The class to follow is PDEFormEditorContributor. The method is 'setSourceActionBarsActive'. This method correctly switches global action handlers between one common set for GUI pages and the one for the embedded text editors, but the action handlers are not covered. The severity set on this defect is not a joke: with keys issued in GUI pages going into the last visited source page, ALL new PDE editors are pretty much useless and no go for M9.
