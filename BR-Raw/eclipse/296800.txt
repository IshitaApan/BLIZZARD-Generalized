[GlobalActions] UI build actions should not lock the workspace

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #198591 +++ Build ID: I20091201-1600 The org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/BuildAction.java performs a background operation that is locking the entire workspace in order to initiate a build. This is unnecessary and counter-productive, since the core/resources system is already taking care of the build and locking resources as needed. The UI should not add any conditions on top of that. A patch fixing the issue in BuildAction is found in bug 198591 attachment 153578, but there are likely other cases where the UI unnecessarily locks resources -- we are still investigating. Background Info: ---------------- After a lot of work and discussion on bug 198591, the core/resources system is going to allow clients define builders which do not necessarily lock the entire workspace against modification. This is a very important enhancement for IDE's with external, long-running build systems such as C/C++ IDE's where the external build can sometimes last for hours. Locking the workspace against any editing while the build is ongoing is not rational in this case, and is also not seen in editors or IDE's other than Eclipse. Note that the modifications on bug 198591 do not change the default behavior of the Eclipse IDE at all, since the default for any builder is still to return the workspace root as scheduling rule and thus lock the entire workspace. But with Eclipse 3.6m4, clients are going to be able and define special builders which are less greedy in terms of locking. rule.
