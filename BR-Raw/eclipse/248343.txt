[DataBinding] Snippet for ValidationStatusProvider implementation

A common usecase is for someone to be using databinding with some custom model. This custom model sometimes comes with its own validation story that can't be ported immediately to databinding or it does something more complicated that people don't like to touch. People like to take advantage of the databinding context for status reporting so uniting both validation stories is important. So imagine a case where you have some: 1) IModel 2) models have a validate() method that return say a IStatus or some status reporting object Let's pretend this model represents a contact entry: - first name - last name - phone number - email You would have bindings for each individual field to some UI like any other databinding application. You would also have an IModel.validate method call that returns some status. You also than have some AggregateValidationStatus that returns the status based on both the databinding validators and the IModel.validate call. Do you understand the case a bit?
