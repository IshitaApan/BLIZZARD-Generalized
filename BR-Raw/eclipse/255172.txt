[Import/Export] Warning message in the import wizard is not so helpful

Created attachment 117768 The warning message Build ID: I20081030-1917 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Try to import a project from a zip file 2. If the project is already available in the workspace, the wizard shows a warning - which doesn't say the project name More information: I encountered it quite a few times. I would try to import a project attached to a bug and the wizard would simply say it already exists. I have no clue of which project that is, because I have quite a few from the bugzilla. Suggestion: Instead of hiding the project, the wizard can probably show the project/projects in the below table. The checkbox can be unchecked & disabled, so that the user can't select it anyway. The warning also can be displayed along to make it clear for the user who is wondering why they are greyed out.
