[Properties dialog] Project / Properties menu item

RC1 There have been several requests to have a Project / Properties menu item which opens the properties dialog on the project for the selected resource. This could be done in two ways: 1) A retargetable action, which views and/or editors can implement. 2) An action which tracks the selected resource itself (checking the selection and editor input, using IAdaptable). The current Project actions that target the selection (Build Project, Rebuild Project, Open Project, Close Project) are all retargetable. There were a few reasons for doing it this way: 1. Reduce the amount of workspace-specific hardwired code built into the workbench (although even the existence of the action is a core dependency). 2. Allow parts to handle them differently than the obvious way (although I can't imagine a case). 3. Retargetable actions already do part tracking. None of these reasons are terribly compelling. However, for 2.1 I'd be inclined to do Project / Properties in the same way, for simplicity and consistency's sake. The Properties item should always appear at the end of the menu, with a separator before it, with the additions group before the separator (and avoid duplicate separators if no additions).
