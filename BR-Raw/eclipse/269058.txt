[UI] Remove product specific code

The current implementation of org.eclipse.e4.workbench.ui.internal.Workbench currently contains code (based on the availability of the LegacyHook) that is specific to running either the compatibility layer (LH == true) or the photo demo (PH == false). We should make the base Workbench logic work whichever of the two 'applications' are running (i.e. based -only- on the difference in their 'default' model XMI).
