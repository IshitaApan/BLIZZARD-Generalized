child scheme keybindings that 'conflict' with parent scheme are not enabled

Build Identifier: 20120322-1740 In 3.x the doc for the org.eclipse.ui.bindings includes the following statement: "It is possible for schemes to inherit bindings from a parent scheme. This is intended to make it easier for plug-in developers to create customized binding sets. An active binding defined in a child scheme will always override an active binding in a parent scheme, if they have the same trigger. " I define a child scheme of org.eclipse.ui.emacsAccelatorConfiguration 	<scheme 		description="%emacsplus.scheme.description" 		id="com.mulgasoft.emacsplusConfiguration" 		name="%emacsplus.scheme.name" 		parentId="org.eclipse.ui.emacsAcceleratorConfiguration"/> However, all key bindings that should override instead cause the Key Assist Dialog to pop up with my binding and the binding in emacs emacsA.... scheme on invocation. No conflicts are reported in the .log file or in the Keys window. This mechanism worked in 3.x but not in e4. My command handler is defined correctly and is callable through my M-x mechansim. Also, I'm unable to locate the corresponding bindings documentation specific to the e4 platform Reproducible: Always
