[Dialogs] jface.Dialog.contrainShellSize() not working correctly for multiple workspaces

When used in an environment where the top-left corner of the display's device boundries are not (0,0), this member function does not act properly and forces properly centered dialogs to be lined up against the edge of the screen (weighted towards the (0,0) desktop. This should effect all windowing systems where there are virtual desktops with changing physical locations. This proplem was found under QNX/Photon.
