[Forms] MSAA problems with FormText , role and default action

This is a partial clone of Bug 178557 - [Forms] MSAA problems with FormText. That bug described 3 separate problems, I have a fix for 2 of the three items which are described below using the description from Bug 178557. I will attach a patch and request approval once I have completed my testing. When executing our product accessibility testing using the Inspect32 MSAA viewer the following problems were discovered on the Update Manager Product Configuration Dialog. (1) (This item is not fixed) (2) When tabbing through and the Scan for Updates link is reached, it shows a value of Role: Editable Text, rather than Role: link as expected and as shown by all other links on this page. (3) All links in the right hand panel show DefAction: as none, but we believe that they should show DefAction as "Press"
