"Close All" and "Close Others" menu options available when right clicking on tab in PartStack when no part is closeable

Build Identifier: I20110620-1631 If I create a PartStack that contains multiple parts but none of the parts are closeable, when I right click on any of the tabs I get menu options for "Close All" and "Close Others". Selection of either of the menu options doesn't cause any tabs to be closed since none of the tabs can be closed. I don't think the menu options should be available if none of the tabs can be closed. I am attaching a patch that will prevent Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create PartStack that contains multiple parts 2. Make sure none of the parts in the stack are marked as closeable. 3. Right click on any of the tabs. A menu will be displayed even though none of the tabs can be closed.
