[Linked Resources] Properties page for linked files and folders

build 20021127 Based on a discussion between Chris and Jeem the properties dialog for a linked folder or linked file should show the following on its 'Info' page. This list differs from the original discussion based on the fact that a link target location cannot be changed after a link has been created. a) That the folder or file is linked (read only) b) The link destination path (read only, shows variable name) (was: always editable) c) The resolved link destination path (read only, produced on-the-fly from b.) {not applicable, no API d) The browse button (always enabled) e) The link variables button (always enabled)} f) A warning indicator if the fully resolved link destination path is syntactically correct but does not exist (produced on-the-fly from b.) or if a variable is not defined. The user should be allowed to press OK to leave this dialog while the warning indicator is lit. g) An error indicator or if the fully resolved link destination path is syntactically incorrect (produced on-the-fly from b.). The user should not be allowed to press OK to leave this dialog while the error indicator is lit.
