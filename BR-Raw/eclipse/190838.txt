[Presentation] Can't drag a non-instantiated view out of a minimized stack

Found in RC3: Fresh WS, minimize the bottom stack Try to drag the 'Declaration' view no drop area are supported If the view has been visible then it works correctly. The problem is that the DnD dropTarget handlers all use a check of the form to prevent dragging between WBW's: draggedPart.getWorkbenchWindow() != getWorkbenchWindow() However, if the 'draggedPart' is a ViewPane whose view has never been displayed then it hasn't had its 'control' defined yet leading to 'draggedPart.getWorkbenchWindow()' always returning 'null' and failing the test. This was impossible in the 3.0 presentation because clicking on a view to drag it in the presentation would activate it; causing the control to be created.
