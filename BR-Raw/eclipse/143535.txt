[Field Assist] - example needs to vary placement of decorations

The field assist example was modified during 3.2 M7 to reflect the latest proposals from the graphic design team as to placement of required field, error, and warning decorations. Unfortunately, this caused me to remove all use of right-hand decorations from the example and allowed bug #142744 to creep in. There should be preferences in the example for placing the decorations in different locations, as well as some variance in the size of at least one decoration so that the centering of larger or smaller decorations can be tested. (For example, just create a decoration on the fly with a drawn rectangle of a size specified in the preferences).
