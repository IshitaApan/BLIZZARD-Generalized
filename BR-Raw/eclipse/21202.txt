Export preferences says file created when it isn't

R2.0 If you choose to export preferences and there is nothing to save then no file is created. However the user is told that a file has been created even if it hasn't. STEPS 1) Open a fresh workspace 2) Open Worklbench->preferences 3) Select a file prefs.eps 4) Hit OK 5) You are given a message that says "preferences exported to prefs.eps" but nothing is created.
