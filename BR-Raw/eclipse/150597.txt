Patch that adds enhancements to GridDataFactory

The layout generator used by GridLayoutFactory.generateLayout cannot generate layouts containing controls that span multiple cells. It would be useful if there was a way to use the generated values but set the spanning explicitly. This patch adds the following enhancements: - Fixes bug 133982 - Adds a static generate(Control, int, int) method to GridDataFactory, which generates layout data for the given control given its span - Adds a vector version of the above generate method (for consistency with the span(...) methods) - Adds a static defaultsFor(Control) method that constructs a new GridDataFactory using the generated values for the given control as defaults. This allows any layout parameter to be tweaked in the same way as span. - Adds examples for the above new methods
