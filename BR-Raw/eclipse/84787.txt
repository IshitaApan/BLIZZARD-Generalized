[Preferences] the preferencePage extension point does not support IExecutableExtension

We're checking for the class attribute in PreferencePageRegistry reader and if it's null we're discarding the extension. IExecutableExtension allows for omission of the attribute in favour of a nested "class" element. PreferencePages which attempt to utilize this feature are being tossed. This likely affects other workbench components that check to ensure a class attribute. I need this addressed for my activities work. I'll fix it up.
