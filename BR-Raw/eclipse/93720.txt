[Workbench] (Regression) XMLMemento converts newlines in string values to spaces on deserialization

A String value containing newline characters, set using xmlMemento.putString("key", "\nvalue\nwith\nnewlines\n"); will come back with spaces instead of newlines after serialization and subsequent deserialization. This was not the case with XMLMemento of release 3.0.1.
