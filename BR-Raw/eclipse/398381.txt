[Contributions] Memory leak when ever calling context menu

Steps to reproduce: Call a context menu in a view/editor more times The memory leak happens when calling a context menu in the Package Explorer view, the Java editor, the Outline view ... Many contribution items and elements are leaked. The issue happens for the following two reasons: - the PopupMenuExtender class seems to have to call the unlink method when the context menu is hidden. - the MenuManagerRendere class contains the sharedElementToRecord hash map that uses MMenuElement as a key. The classes that implement the MMenuElement interface don't override hashCode (and equals), but the ContributionRecord.mergeIntoModel method clones those elements that are contributed using the 'popup:org.eclipse.ui.popup.any' uri. That's why the sharedElementToRecord hash map contains leaked elements. I have solved the issue so that the PopupMenuExtender remembers such entries and clears them when the menu is hidden. Attached is a patch.
