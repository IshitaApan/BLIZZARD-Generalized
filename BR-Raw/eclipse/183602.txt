[EditorMgmt] provide API for restoring multiple editors without materialization

The discussion related to this request is on bug 138666. To summarize, there are several use cases for tools that require more than one editor to be opened. For example, the user may select multiple files in a navigator view or Open Resource dialog. Currently the only supported way to open each editor is by repeatedly invoking a method such as: IDE.openEditor(activePage, (IFile)resource, false); This is unnecessarily slow when there are many editors to open because each of the editors will materialize (e.g. load an Outline, parse the corresponding compilation unit). What's desired is a method along the lines of: IDE.openEditors(IWorkbenchPage page, IFile[] files) This would cause only a single editor to materialize (e.g. the first in the array). Other editors would materialize on demand, i.e. when the the user clicks the corresponding tab.
