[Compatibility] Keyboard shortcut for view menu doesn't work in standalone views

Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I20111205-2330 Cmd-F10, Cmd-Shift-F10, and Shift-F10 normally bring up the gutter menu, system view menu, and context menu (respectively). They fail to work in standalone views. Means to test: 1. Open a perspective with standalone views. I'll attach my own customized version of the Java Browsing perspective here, or you can optionally install the tiny package of hacks from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/eclipse-tools/ (not categorized, called Brian's Hacks) or download the plugin and add it to your target platform http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bsd/eclipse-tools/plugins/bsd.eh_0.0.6.jar 2. Start Eclipse 3. Set the focus to one of the standalone views and click one of the shortcut keys. See nothing happen.
