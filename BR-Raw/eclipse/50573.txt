[Jobs] Need to make verbose and progress window state persist over sessions

In Progress View in 3.0M6 the Verbose filter doesnt stay selected. When I restart Eclipse, it is turned off again. What I really want it for is for the Verbose comments from CVS, I was to see, what files are being received or how big they are when being received and how much was already received. Not only do I have to alway turn the Verbose on, I also have to expand the tree node with + which is quite annoying.
