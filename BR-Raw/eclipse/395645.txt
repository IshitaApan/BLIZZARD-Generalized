Progress view can show finished job as unfinished (race condition introduced by bug 258352)

The fix to bug 258352 introduced a race condition in the Progress viewer. The code that tries to ensure the update job runs no more than once every 100 ms is prone to a race condition. The update job is scheduled with a 100ms delay, and subsequent calls to schedule another update has an overly simplistic test for determining if a job is already scheduled. This can lead to an update being erroneously skipped. This reproduces easily for me with a simple example (attached). Open the Progress view then invoke the RunJobs command (CTRL+6). On my machine, about 30% of time the job ends up shown as incomplete when it in fact has completed. I'm attaching a git patch created with git diff. Much of the delta is due to a scope addition indenting code).
