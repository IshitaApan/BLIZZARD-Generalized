[Commands][Mac] context menu submenus are disabled when selecting on OSX

I20080519-2000 This is somewhat difficult to reproduce, but I've seen it a couple of times happening now: 1. In the package explorer select an element 2. Right click to open its context menu 3. Right click it again 4. Select a sub menu entry in the context menu Is: The entry becomes disabled, this happens with most (i.e. New>) but not all submenus Should: Not disable and open the submenu As I said, it might be required to try that a couple of times until it happens. Another way to reproduce it quite reliable is to right click the element a couple of times, like 20 times, and then try to open a submenu. This happens in other views too, i.e. the markers view. This is major if not critical. Not sure if it is SWT or Platform. OSX Version 10.4.11, java.runtime.version=1.5.0_07-164
