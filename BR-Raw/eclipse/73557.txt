[Dialogs] Pattern matching changes Open Resource type-ahead behaviour

If I use the "Open Resource" dialog (Ctrl-Shift-r) and being typing, it lists matches as though there is an implicit '*' at the end. E.g. if I being typing "MyF", it will show "MyFunClass.java", "MyFoobar.java", etc. But if I add a '*' at the beginning, and start typing e.g. "*F", it doesn't show the same list of files. Instead, only anything ending with 'F' is shown. I've tried this with a couple of other expressions, and it seems that if any regular expression is used, the behaviour of the dialog changes -- there is no longer considered to be a '*' at the end. I think this is confusing behaviour. If I add a manually add a '*' at the end of my expression, and then begin typing before the '*', I get the behaviour that I would expect.
