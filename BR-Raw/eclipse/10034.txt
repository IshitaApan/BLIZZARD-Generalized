Inconsistent file structure for export selected directories

Since the version 2.0, we have an abnormal behaviour with the export function. With 1.0 version, if we have a project name <test> with a default package and a package called <pactest>, and choose to export this project into a file systme folder <foldertest>, the result is : - all the classes of default package are exported directly in the root of this folder - all the classes of <pactest> are exported in the subfolder <pactest> Now, with the version 2.0, - all the classes of default package are exported directly in the root of this folder - eclipse creates a subfolder with the name of the projet, here "test" and all the classes of <pactest> are exported in the subfolder <pactest> of this new folder. So, I don't if it's a bug or not. But I think we have to choose between two ways : - the export funtion works as the version 1.0 - Eclipse creates a folder with projet name, but in this case, put the default packages classes in the root of this subfolder and not directly in the target folder. Thanks and sorry for my poor english. David. PS : Congratulations for Eclipse Product
