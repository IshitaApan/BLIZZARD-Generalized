Can't start external program which is not under plugin folder as editor

Can't start external program which is not placed unser plugin folder as editor. Here is a plugin.xml faragment: <editor name="My External Editor" icon="icons/full/cview16/editor.gif" extensions="test" command="notepad.exe" id="com.ibm.etools.systems.externaleditor"> </editor> and notepad doesn't start. In ExternalEditor class's openWithUserDefinedProgram() method: try { // See if the program file is in the plugin directory .. programFileName = file.getAbsolutePath(); <-- This returns wrong full path of notepad.exe } catch (IOException e) { // Program file is not in the plugin directory <-- There is no IOException at here. } if (programFileName == null) <---- programFileName doesn't null. programFileName = descriptor.getFileName(); So that, the method tries to start notepad.exe with wrong full path name, and fails.
