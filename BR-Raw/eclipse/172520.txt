[Contributions] Improve the "Invalid Menu Extension" message

I20070130-0800. If menu paths are wrong the following error is logged: !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 17:56:43.303 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): <menu id here> There are two problems with this message: 1. it does not tell which plug-in contributed that menu 2. it does not show the parent menu path that's missing but only shows the id of the menu that should be added to that parent
