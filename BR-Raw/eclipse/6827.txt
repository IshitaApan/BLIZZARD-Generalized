Delete project reports "internal errors" with normal use case

1) Create a java project "Foo", containing file "abc.txt" 2) In the filesystem, delete "abc.txt". 3) In the packages view, select project "Foo" and hit delete. 4) To the delete content question, click "Yes". An error dialog pops up. message: Unexpected exception. See log for details. Reason: Status. Details: Resource is out of sync with the file system: /Foo/abc.txt If you follow the same steps, but delete some folder in the filesystem, the log file reports "Internal Errors". Cases like this shouldn't report "unexpected exceptions" and "internal errors"... this is expected to be quite a common scenario when people are using external tools on their source files. I believe this is a use case we should handle more gracefully. The resources plugin provides facilities in its API for dealing with this, namely the IResourceStatus#OUT_OF_SYNC_LOCAL status code, and the "force" flag on all API methods.
