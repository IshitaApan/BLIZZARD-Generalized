[DataBinding] Multiple validation statuses per binding

The current implementation of Data Binding assumes that all validation is fail fast and only one status can be reported. There's a proposal on the table for returning multiple statuses in forms and dialogs (see bug 168769). We need to make a decision on if we want to stick to the fail fast implementation for 1.0 or move to something to support the coming enhancements in forms and dialogs. Another thing to consider is validation policies. I was looking at implementing the explicit policy in ValueBinding and ran into an issue with the validation policy. The idea for this policy was to support validation in dialogs where we don't want to update the model automatically but we still want to perform validation as the user is entering the data. There's another use case of wanting to defer expensive validation until the user selects OK/Apply. The dialog validation and multiple statuses might be 2 separate issues but it might help to evaluate both when discussing this enhancement. Also this is a high priority as it effects API and 3.3M5 is the API freeze. I'm willing to start work on this this weekend (as long as no one else claims it) if necessary and as long as we can come to an agreement on what to do.
