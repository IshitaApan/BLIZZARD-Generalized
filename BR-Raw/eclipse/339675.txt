[Compatibility] View tool bar doesn't layout properly

I20110310-2200 1. Open the 'Breakpoints' view. 2. Place the 'Breakpoints' view into the same stack as the 'Outline' view. 3. Resize the stack horizontally so that the view's tool bar can be seen completely. 4. Switch to the 'Outline' view. 5. Switch back to the 'Breakpoints' view. 6. Now the tool bar is obscured. A resize will correct the problem.
