New path variable created unexpectedly

One of the latest 3.6 IBuilds Steps: 1) Create a general project (let's call is 'project1') 2) Go to Project Properties and make sure that there are only dynamic path variables 2) Drag and drop a folder with a subfolder and files inside to 'project1' In my case it is c:/Folder > SubFolder > a.txt 3) In the "File and Folder Import" dialog, choose 'Automatic' (or later 'Default') and 'Recreate with Virtual Folders and Links' 4) Go to Project Properties again and see that a new variable is added ('C' which is defined relatively to PROJECT_LOC) 5) Open Properties for myProject/Folder/SubFolder/a.txt and see that its location is defined using this new 'C' variable. I should be at least asked if I want Eclipse to create any variables for me.
