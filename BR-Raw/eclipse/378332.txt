Toggle Full Screen command should work with the fullscreen button in title bar

Eclipse 4.2 I20120502-1800 The Toggle Full Screen command doesn't seem to work in combination with the Full Screen button in the title bar. This happens both when trying to enter and exit fullscreen mode. Steps to reproduce: 1. In the IDE, click on the fullscreen button on title bar to enter fullscreen mode. 2. Click on the Toggle Full Screen menu item or press Cmd+Ctrl+F to return to normal mode. This doesn't work. 3. Clicking on the menu item again works. It also happens when trying to enter fullscreen mode: 1. Click on Toggle Full Screen menu item to enter fullscreen mode. 2. exit fullscreen mode using the exit fullscreen button on the right of the menu bar. 3. Now try to enter fullscreen mode again using menu item or Cmd+Ctrl+F shortcut. This doesn't work. 4. Trying again using menuitem or the shortcut works. I tried this with Mail and Xcode and it works there.
