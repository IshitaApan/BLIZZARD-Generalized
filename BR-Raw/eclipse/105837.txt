[Markers] Mnemonic conflicts in Marker views

3.1.1 Due to the fixes for Bug 105809 we have 4 conflicting mnemonics for Ascending and Descending in our filters dialogs. As this will require extra Strings to be added to the properties files this should not be fixed in 3.1.1 without permission from the TVT teams.
