[DND] Incorrect javadoc for NavigatorDragAdapter

Build 20020924 The javadoc that is generated for NavigatorDragAdapter (look in reference section of online help), looks like this: void dragFinished(DragSourceEvent event) This implementation of dragFinished does nothing. void dragSetData(DragSourceEvent event) This implementation of dragSetData does nothing. void dragStart(DragSourceEvent event) This implementation of dragStart permits the drag operation to This javadoc is incorrect. It has been copied from the generic superclass DragSourceAdapter. I guess we need to override the javadoc for API classes in cases where the implementation differs significantly from the superclass. There are probably many more examples of this throughout the UI.
