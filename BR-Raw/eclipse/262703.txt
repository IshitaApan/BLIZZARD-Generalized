View does not receive focus when row in embedded TableViewer is selected

Created attachment 123984 Simple example RCP project to reproduce the problem Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: In an RCP project with a view containing a TableViewer where double-clicking on a table row opens an editor on the row model (see attachement for an example): 1. Double-click on a row in the table inside the view to open an editor on the selected row. 2. Click on another row in the table. 3. Note that the view containing the table does not receive focus (the editor still has focus, although it is possible to select rows in the table. Consequently double-clicks on other rows do not open the correct editors. 4. Switch to another application and back to this one (e.g. via Alt+Tab on Windows). 5. Note that the view now receives focus (as it should have when the table row was clicked). More information: The attachement viewBug.zip contains a simple barebones example of a setup that reproduces this problem (tested in Ganymede under WinXP).
