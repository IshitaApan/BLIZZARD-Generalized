[Wizard] Page description not set if page message already set

Since page messages such as errors and warnings used to be displayed in the same widget as the page description, code was put in place in WizardDialog#updateDescriptionMessage() to avoid setting the page description if there was already a message. As of 3.2 M6 there is a separate widget for displaying error and warning messages and so the page description should always be set.
