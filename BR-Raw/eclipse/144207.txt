next / prev not working anymore in search view

RC6 Seems to be a regression since RC4. - create a new Java file with content below - in the Java editor use 'Ctrl + .' and 'Ctrl + ,' (Next / Previous) to toggle through the 2 errors in the file - select 'args', Invoke 'Search > Occurrences In File > Indentifier' - set focus to the search view (3 matches) and try to use 'Ctrl + .' 'Ctrl + ,' to go through the search results. -> does nothing in the search view but still toggles highlighting in the editor - same problem with the prev / next toolbar buttons of the search view Using the global menu actions, this works. I verified that this bug was not yet in RC4 (I20060512-1600) ----- A.java package pack; import java.util.List; import java.util.List2; public class A implements List { 	/** 	 * @param args 	 */ 	public static void main(String[] args) { 		System.out.println(args[0]); 	} }
