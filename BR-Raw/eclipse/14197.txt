Removing a working set immediatly makes changes

20020418 1. create a working set with one project and select it -> package view is filtered 2. Open the working set dialog again, create a second working set, delete the first. -> At the moment of delete, the package view in the background refilters. In my opinion refiltering should only happen when closing the working set selection dialog, not while manipulating. I also think that pressing cancel should cancel all changes I did to woking sets (-> cancel the remove)
