Can't use custom perspective

20020430 I modified the Resource perspective to show the CVS Repo view, then saved it as a custom perspective. Every time I then click on the repository icon at the far left, I get a second icon appearing at the far left, and I get into a state where multiple repository icons appear as selected.
