[Dialogs] DCR: ErrorDialog should not always show the error icon (1GJU7TK)

The class org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ErrorDialog is used to display errors 	contained in an IStatus. The problem with the dialog is that it shows an 	error icon (red/cross) even though IStatus only has warnings or infos. 	The dialog would be more usable if the icon would correspond to the severity 	of IStatus and/or the dialog would offer to specify the image type (error, warning, info). NOTES:
