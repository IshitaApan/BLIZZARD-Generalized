[Commands] ActionHandler leak

I200404281424 Sorry this bug report does not totally pinpoint the problem. It would appear that not all HandlerSubmissions are getting removed from the WorkbenchCommandSupport or are staying around from the handlerSubmissions of the active workbench window. These in turn are hanging on to the ActionHandlers. Test case: Open a Java Editor using the File menu history close the editor <<GC using Optimize It>> <<Mark the current instance count>> Open a Java Editor using the File menu history close the editor <<GC using Optimize It>> Most cases I am seeing up to 300 new ActionHandlers per editor (about 10k).
