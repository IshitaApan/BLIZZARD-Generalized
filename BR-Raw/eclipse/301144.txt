[LinkedResources] "File and Folder Import" dialog polishing

This very useful dialog needs polishing. Some of issues to fix are: 1. We should add a help for this dialog. Maybe there should be a question mark in the corner that opens help in the tray. 2. I think that labels may not be clear for people. For instance "Always perform the selected operation in this context"... what context? 3. IMO titles for radio buttons may be confusing too. For instance "Create links for each file and directory", one could think that we create linked resources one by one for each file and directory, but we just create linked resources for the top level files and directories, right? Anyway labels should be short and explained in the help IMO. 4. The dialog title should not say "Import" , this is just a copy operation IMO, so maybe "Copy Files and Folders" or just "Copy"
