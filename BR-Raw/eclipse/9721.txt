Performance: avoid writing empty preference files

(After conversation with RG) A plug-in's preference store is being written to a file even when there are no preference setting to remember. This is pointless and wasteful. Instead, when a plug-in's preference store does not contain any genuine entries, no file should be written (an existing file must be deleted). This simple change would improve preference saving ( which is also done on plug-in shutdown).
