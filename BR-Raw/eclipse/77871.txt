[GlobalActions] (Re)Build Project should track resources itself

3.1 M3 See bug 53936. Currently Build Project and Rebuild Project are retargetable actions, requiring all resource-oriented views and editors to supply a handling action in order to integrate well with the IDE. We should replace the Build Project and Rebuild Project actions with non-retargetable actions that look to the current part's selection and/or editor input, rather than requiring each resource-oriented view and editor to provide a handling action. This, however, could be a breaking change, if an existing part provides its own handler but does not expose a selection provider, or if it has a more interesting implementation than just obtaining the resource from the selection (and/or editor input). We could address this by: if (part hooks a handler) { delegate to it; // current behaviour } else { if (part's selection provider has resource(s)) { obtain the project(s) from the selection; } else if (part is an editor and its input adapts to IResource or IFile) { obtain the project from the editor input; } }
