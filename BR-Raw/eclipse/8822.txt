[Serviceability] Add button to show log from error dialog

Build 20020125 The error dialog should have a button which will show the error log. Simply opening it an editor would be one option. Or in its own simple shell with text widget (need to handle large files though). The minimal requirement is that it support cut. May need to add error handling hooks to JFace to do this, if its event loop is the one catching the exceptions.
