[JFace] Localized resource registries for JFace

Please provide improved JFace support for managing SWT resources, with the following properties: - A registry can allocate and deallocate SWT resources given a descriptor - Resources are reference-counted and shared, allowing different objects with equivalent descriptors to share resources. - Everything in the registry can be deallocated with one function call - The registry should support an open-ended set of resources (and should initially support, at minimum, Images, Fonts, Colors) - It should be possible to create a "local registry" that behaves like a regular registry but actually shares its resources with a global registry. For example, the workbench could offer a local registry as a service to views and editors. This would allow views and editors to safely allocate and deallocate SWT resources without any chance of leaking.
