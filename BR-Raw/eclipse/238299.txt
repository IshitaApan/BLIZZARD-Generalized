[Viewers] Collapse All before expanding class/array suppresses display of all but first child node

Created attachment 105732 screen shot of Variables view If you hit Collapse All before expanding a class object or array, that object appears to contain only one child (the first) until the next update (step, etc.). See attached screen shot and the trivial Java program below. To reproduce, set a breakpoint on the line containing the println() call, debug it, hit the Collapse All button in the Variables view, then expand "item" or "arr". Only the first child will be displayed. Step, and the other children magically appear. package com.tensilica.eclipse.bugs; public class Bug96 { 	int one = 1; 	int two = 2; 	/** 	 * @param args 	 */ 	public static void main(String[] args) { 		int[] arr = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4}; 		Bug96 item = new Bug96(); 		System.err.println("Stop here, arr[0] = " + arr[0] + ", item.one = " + item.one); 	} }
