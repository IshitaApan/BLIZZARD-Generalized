[Preferences] cannot remove file association from Workbench preferences

I added a file association into Window / Preferences / Workbench / File Association , which worked fine. Then I tried to remove the new file extension, using the "Remove" button. It seems to remove it from the list OK, but the change is not being persisted. When I close out the preferences dialog, and then open it back up, the deleted file extension comes back. I am using the M1 build dated 09-20-2002.
