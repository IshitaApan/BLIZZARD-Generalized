[Contexts] performance: Slow cursor navigation in Text fields

N20050623-0010-gtk Not sure whether this is my particular install or a new problem. With the above build, cursor navigation in any text field is extremely slow. Steps: - open the Find dialog (alternatively: open the preference dialog, or the Team>Create Patch wizard) - in a text field, enter some text, at least 20 characters - press and hold the ARROW_LEFT / _RIGHT keys Expected: I see the caret move through the entered text Actual: The cursor does not visibly change its position until after releasing the key plug some delay. Notes: - keyboard repeat rate is at the default - the same works fine (+/- at least nowhere near the slowness of Text fields) in text editors - other applications do not show this behavior This is quite bad as the caret cannot be placed reliably this way. Will try to reproduce with an SWT-only example.
