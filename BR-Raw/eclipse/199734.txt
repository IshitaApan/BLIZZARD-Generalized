[Progress] Progress view shows two entries for same job - only one is updated

Build ID: I20070621-1340 Steps To Reproduce: 1. create the job (* extends Job) 2. addJobChangeListener(): implemented done() method of the listener to refresh the ui 3. setRule(): prevent job instances running at the same time job's run() method: 4. bring progress view to front 5. count files and file size (recursive) 6. call beginTask() on the monitor (totalWork is 100, for 100%) file transfer (recursive): 7. for each file (in all directories) setTaskName is called on the monitor with the file name as parameter 8. update progress regularly (for now it is every second) using subTask on the progress monitor The sub task information is used to show the progress in transferred kB and the estimated remaining time to finish the job. More information: Looked like Bug 180205, which seems not to be fixed in eclipse europa version. Now as a new bug: I got 2 job entries for the same job in the progress view in an own rcp project. It is a file transfer job (ftp). The job is created only once and scheduled to run as soon as possible. The progress monitor is updated using setTaskName() and subTask() methods. I don't know if one of the two methods causes the bug or maybe calling them multiple times. Only the progress bar and the task name/subtask of the first/top entry is updated correctly, the second entry shows the state when the other entry was created. The workaround is to delete all finished tasks. So the call FinishedJobs.getInstance().clearAll(); in one of the methods of my job removes the doubled job entry. Since FinishedJobs is in an internal package the progress view should be updated correctly.
