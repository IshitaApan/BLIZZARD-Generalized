[CommonNavigator] WorkingSetFilterActionGroup sometimes not updated on WS changes

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 Build Identifier: 3.5 I am extending common navigator such that it creates few working sets on the start-up of the workbench. I hit an issue with the "Select Working Set" dialog, it does not "selects" the created working set. I debugged and found that WorkingSetFilterActionGroup.setWorkingSet() in org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.resources.actions.WorkingSetActionProvider is initialized to working set based on the value of currentWorkingSetName set in workbench.xml. Opening up the API in WorkingSetActionProvider to set working set in WorkingSetFilterActionGroup should make it work. Reproducible: Always
