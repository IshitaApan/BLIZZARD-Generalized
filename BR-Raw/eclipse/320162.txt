E4CommandProcessor.createBinding catch IllegalArgumentException which is never thrown

The code looks like this: TriggerSequence sequence = null; 		try { 			sequence = bs.createSequence(keySequence); 		} catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { 			// the sequence is not complete 			Activator.trace(Policy.DEBUG_MENUS, "failed to create: " + binding, ex); //$NON-NLS-1$ 			return null; 		} But when looking at code in KeySequence.getInstance the only Exceptions thrown are: * NPE * ParseException (catched in BindingServiceImpl) I guess the code should catch the NPE and not the never thrown IAE
