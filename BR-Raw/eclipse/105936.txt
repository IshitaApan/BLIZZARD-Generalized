[Contributions] interactions: No submenu for "Run As"

I20050803-0800 I have org.eclipse.swt, org.eclipse.swt.examples, and org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86 in my workspace. When I open the context menu on a .java file in the package explorer for one of the eclipse examples, the option "Run As" has no submenu at all.
