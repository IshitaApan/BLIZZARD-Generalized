[StatusHandling] Comments on new StatusManager API

Build: I20061108-0800 I stumbled across the new StatusManager API and have a few comments: 1) The "handling hint" is not very well specified. For example, StatusManager#handle just says: 	 * @param hint 	 * handling hint And StatusHandlingState#getHandlingHint just says: 	 * @return Returns the handlingHint. I can guess that the IGNORE, LOG, SHOW, etc constants on the StatusManager are the handling hints, but their javadoc doesn't say that. I suggest that these constants have their doc reworded as "A handling hint indicating that...". And, either list the possible hint values or describe where to find the list of possible hints where it is referenced as a parameter or return type. You may also want to consider making the hints bit mask values, so that more hints can be added in the future and hints can be combined. That would eliminate the need for StatusManager.SHOWANDLOG, which could be replaced by (SHOW | LOG). As it is, you won't be able to make this change in future releases because SHOW is defined as 3 and LOG is defined as 1 (overlapping mask values). 2) StatusHandlingState and AbstractStatusHandler need real javadoc. This kind of javadoc is not much help: 	/** 	 * @return Returns the params. 	 */ 	public Map getParams() {...} 	/** 	 * @return Returns the contributorName. 	 */ 	public String getContributorName() {...} 	/** 	 * @return Returns the id. 	 */ 	public String getId() {...} What's a "param"? What type are the keys and values in the param map? What's a "contributorName" or an "id"? etc... Are the classes intended to be instantiated/subclassed by clients? 3) The new package needs a package.html, and needs adding to the help index.
