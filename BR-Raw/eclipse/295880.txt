[context] Context-to-Injector link streamlining

Created attachment 152863 Patch Over time the link between context and injector has become unclear; some asssumtions as to who creates whom no longer true; and some APIs developed in less-than-perfect places. On API front there are some changes, mostly trivial: Contexts: - IEclipseContext#make() becomes ContextInjectionFactory#make() Injectors: - Public API for injectors (Injector class) changed - IObjectProvider gets a new method #getInjector() The internal implementation of the link chnages significanly: - The ContextInjectionFactory now [lazily] creates one injector per context and stores it in the context itself. (Before we were actually creating an injector for every inject operation.) - ContextToObjectLink class is gone, the ContextInjector itself maintains the list of objects that have been injected, and the ObjectProviderContext listens for context modifications. - ContextInjectionImpl class is gone, functinality migrated into ContextInjectionFactory and ContextInjector.
