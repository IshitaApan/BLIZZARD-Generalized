"Fast view" doesn't collapse when clicking on an empty editor area

Created attachment 218558 Screenshot I20120710-0800 I'm using minimized view stacks just like I did use fast views. Today I noticed one more missing bit, in addition to bug 384240. If I expand a view from the minimized stack I would like to be able to close the view by clicking outside it. This works fine if I click on an editor or a different view, but in 3.x, with fast views, it worked even if I clicked on an empty editors area.
