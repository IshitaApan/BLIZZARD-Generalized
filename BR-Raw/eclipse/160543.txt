[FastViews] View Menu button needs accessible name

I20060922-0010 Get inspect32.exe from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3755582A-A707-460A-BF21-1373316E13F0&displaylang=en Click the Download button to the right of inspect32.exe Start eclipse. Start inspect32.exe, and under Options, check "Show Highlight Rectangle". This shows you which widget has focus as you tab around in eclipse. Using a combination of "Ctrl+Tab" (forward tab traversal) and "Shift+Tab" (backward tab traversal), change the focus to the "Show View as a Fast View" button. (Note that only "Ctrl+Tab" will get you out of an editor). Now look at the "Name:" that is showing in the inspect32.exe window: "none [false]". This should be: "Show View as a Fast View". The way to achieve this is to add an AccessibleListener to the toolbar, and make the listener implement the getName method, which needs to set the value of event.result to the desired string for the current toolbutton. So the following code (approximately) needs to go in the org.eclipse.ui.internal.presentations.defaultpresentation.DefaultTabFolder constructor (maybe other places as well): actualToolBar.getAccessible().addAccessibleListener(new AccessibleAdapter() { 	public void getName(AccessibleEvent e) { 	 if (e.childID == actualToolBar.indexOf(pullDownButton)) { 	 	e.result = WorkbenchMessages.Menu; 	 } 	} }); (also need to make actualToolBar and pullDownButton final and add the import for org.eclipse.swt.accessibility.*)
