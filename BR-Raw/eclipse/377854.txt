[About] About Features Dialog's Info Area does not scroll when message is long

Build Identifier: org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.6.1.M20100826-1330 The org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.AboutFeaturesDialog's AboutFeaturesPage has got an Info Area where the legal/copyright/description of a feature is displayed. The StyledText containing the message is not scrollable and the feature's message is cut off if too long. There was an identical problem with the "main" About dialog - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=188652. The bug 188652 is resolved in eclipse 3.7 and 4.2. Since the fix/patch used (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=186237&action=diff) is already available, it can also be applied/adjusted for this problem here. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open About Dialog 2. Select a feature(with a hopefully long-enough description) 3. The description displayed in the About Feature Dialog is not fully visible. No scrollbar available
