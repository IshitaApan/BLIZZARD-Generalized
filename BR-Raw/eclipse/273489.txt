[Mac] We should not nest sheets

Prakash pointed me at this. See http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Sheets/Tasks/UsingCascadingSheets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001046-BABFIBIA "Cocoa does not support the notion of cascading, or nested sheets" One (really bad) example of nested dialogs that are now shown as sheets is: 1. File > New > File 2. Click "Advanced" 3. Check "Link to file ..." 4. Click "Variables..." - sheet opens - 5. Click "New..." - nested sheet opens - 6. Click "Folder..." - yet another nested sheet opens - Perhaps the response to 5. should be to open a normal dialog? Any comments?
