[Trim] [Trim] Trim contributions not disabled during editor save

3.3 M6 During an editor save operation, it disables the window except for the cancel button in the status line. Trim contributions aren't currently covered by that though. E.g. we have a search trim contribution. The user can enter text in here and start a search while an editor save is still going on.
