[Contributions] Improve toolbar configurability

20070417 The current way of configuring the items shown on the toolbar is limited as items can only be enabled/disabled by action set. a.) need a way to enable/disable single toolbar items The workaround to define more action sets is not the same, as each action set creates a vertical separator on the toolbar. The list of action sets also gets very big and hard to manage. b.) want to enable/disable toolbar items independent from menus Currently disabling a action set removes toolbar buttons and menus. c.) Add a context menu to the toolbar with a 'Configure Toolbar...' action. The current way: Window > Customize Perspective > Commands.. is not intuitive (I miss the term 'Toolbar' here). This comes from discussion in bug 181040 (remove New Java project from toolbar), and would be, IMO, a requirement before we start changing tool bar items.
