[Dialogs] XML dialog settings cannot start with a comment

I created a dialog_settings.xml for my plugin, and entered on the very first line a comment: the settings then fail to load with ClassCastException. An easy workaround is to push the comment down into the XML tree. org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.DialogSettings line 181: Element root = (Element) document.getFirstChild(); If the first child is not an element (e.g. a comment), ClassCastException is thrown.
