[Viewers] Problems with TreeSelection#equals(..) and StructuredSelection#equals(..)

N20060410-0010 TreeSelection#equals(..) is not symmetric with StructuredSelection#equals(..): - TreeSelection#equals(..) is always false if the argument is not instanceof TreeSelection - StructuredSelection.equals(..) can be true if the argument is a TreeSelection 3 Problems: (1) equals(..) should be symmetric, as defined in Object#equals(..) (2) hashCode() of both classes must return the same if objects are equal (currently, StructuredSelection#hashCode() is not even implemented!) (3) equality is currently only defined for the implementations. Should be defined on interfaces, since clients generally only know about the interface, not the implementation.
