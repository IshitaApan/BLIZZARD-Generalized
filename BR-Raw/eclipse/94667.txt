[KeyBindings] preference page: Export writes bad CSV file

Eclipse's key bindings export feature fails to use required double-quote characters to enclose fields whose text includes commas. (Commas are often included in the "Key Sequence" field's text.) Applications such as Microsoft Excel to interpret the comma as a field delimiter instead of as part of the intended text. Instead of reading four fields, Excel reads five fields with the fourth field being empty.
