[Presentations] Misplaced view toolbar

Build Identifier: 20100917-0705 In our RCP application we initialize all views of a perspective to display the correct view titles when changing the locale. We do this on part activation where we call "page.findView" or "page.getViews". With this the "createPartControl" method of each view will be called and each view will be initialized (also with its toolbar, etc.). We had no problem with Eclipse 3.3, but now when upgrading to Eclipse 3.6.1 we got a problem with the proceeding mentioned above. With Eclipse 3.6.1 the toolbar of each view toolbar which is in the background after startup will be displayed above the view title bar of the view located in the upper left corner. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a project e.g. like the RCP mail template project. 2. Create another view with a view toolbar. 3. Add the view to the folder layout. 4. Start the application.
