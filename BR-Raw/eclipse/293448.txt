[Perspectives] Removing new/view/perspective shortcuts hides menu items forever until the perspective is reset

Build id: I20091027-0100 1. Window > Customize Perspective... > Shortcuts 2. Select 'Open Perspective' in the submenus combo control. 3. Turn them all off. 4. Select 'Show View' in the submenus combo control. 5. Turn them all off. 6. Click 'OK'. 7. 'Window > Open Perspective' is now missing. 'Window > Show View' is also missing. I'd expect them to still be there for the 'Other...' option, or is this the intended behaviour? 8. Window > Customize Perspective... > Shortcuts 9. Select 'Open Perspective' in the submenus combo control. 10. Turn some stuff back on. 11. Select 'Show View' in the submenus combo control. 12. Turn some stuff back on. 13. Both 'Window > Open Perspective' and 'Window > Show View' is _still_ missing! o.O
