[StatusHandling] Reference to internal class in StatusManager API

The StatusManager API has a reference to the internal class WorkbenchErrorHandlerProxy which will be a broken link as it does not show up in the javadoc. WorkbenchErrorHandlerProxy is obsolete I think so we can likely fix this by deleting it.
