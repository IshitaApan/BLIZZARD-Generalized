Usability: No way indicate a warning in a wizard (1GEAR6U)

EG (5/25/01 9:33:33 PM) from GDA Add AbstractDocument.AttributeContext o It displays an error/info in the banner area but there is no icon to draw your attention to it so it goes unnoticed. NOTES: EG (5/25/01 9:34:54 PM) 	wizard only supports to show errors there is no API to show a warning. All we can do is to change the 	description.
