[FastView] Views cannot get focus when opening as FastView and dragging to a position

When opening a view as fast view and immediately dragging it to another position, the view cannot get focus.... I use the properties view as example, but the problem originally detected with a terminal view (bug 212793)... * Given any perspective, with a properties view * On Eclipse upper right, press "+" button to open a new perspective that has no properties view * On Eclipse lower left, press "+" button to open a new Fast View: Pick Other... > General > Properties as FastView. * Once shown, immediately drag&drop the Properties View to a different pane (e.g. dock at the lower part of the Editor Pane). --> The properties view shows the same contents as the original properties view in the other perspective --> But the properties view never receives any focus, it's not possible to type in it.
