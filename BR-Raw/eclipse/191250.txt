[FastView] [Presentations] 3.0 representation and fast view bar

Build ID: Build id: I20070601-1539 Steps To Reproduce: 1.select 3.0 representation on general preferences 2.switch between two perspectives (mine is SQL Explorer (plugin) and cdt (c/c++)) 3.I have dock on left as fast views on both perspectives the available views (that are by default suggested). e.g. Make targets,Outline,C/C++ projects etc for the C/C++ perspective and Database structure,Database detail etc for SQL Explorer. When switching between perspectives the fast view side bar do not change and it shows always the side bar of the perspective that is loaded first on startup. After selecting the default representation from Window->Preferences->General ->Appearance instead of 3.0 representation everything is working.
