[Decorators] Lightweight Decorator Manager holds onto element in lightweight runnable

Created attachment 87518 Decorators test project Build ID: M20070112-1330 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a tree with DecoratingLabelProvider and one or more decorators defined vi ex.pt. org.eclipse.ui.decorators 2. Create content provider with sufficient memory footprint. 3. Open an UI that displays and decorates your tree. 4. Close all UI. If you had more than one UI, close everything that uses 5. LightweightDecoratorManager#LightweightRunnable continues to hold a reference to content provider data (in Object element member variable). The reset() method is never called. More information: If there is any way to reset it (apart from disabling the decorator altogether) I have not found it. My understanding was that I did not have to do anything to clear up after the label provider is gone. See attached project.
