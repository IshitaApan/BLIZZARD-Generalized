[Workbench] [About] ISharedImages.IMG_OBJ_ADD has no Image

Build ID: M20080911-1700 PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getSharedImages() .getImage(ISharedImages.IMG_OBJ_ADD) returns null, although the Javadoc on ISharedImages states that "This class provides Image and ImageDescriptors for each named image in the interface." I tried all other IMG_OBJ_* images -- for each of those an image is returned. I have not tried all the other images defined in ISharedImages.
