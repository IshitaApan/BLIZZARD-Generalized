[Progress] ProgressManager$JobMonitor mishandles empty subtask

ProgressManager$JobMonitor#subTask(...) is implemented such that it does nothing if the 'name' parameter is a 0-length string. This is a problem because it makes the JobMonitor doesn't correctly update for code that uses the method of clearing a monitor's subtask (subTask("")). For example, this is incompatible with the way that SubProgressMonitors work (see SubProgressMonitor#done()). The workaround that clients used to trick the JobMonitor into working correctly is to call subTask(" ").
