[Progress] Jobs started from ProgressViewerContentProvider doesn't check if viewer is disposed

Build ID: M20080221-1800 My users sometimes gets an error dialog with title 'Remove finished' and message 'Error'. I don't know how to consistently reproduce this error. Looking at the progress viewer code it appears that the jobs started from the KeptJobsListener doesn't check if the viewer was disposed when they have the chance of running and cause this error. I guess that the combination of circumstances that causes the viewer to be disposed while the jobs are waiting to run is hard to reproduce, however I think that the jobs should check anyway if the viewer was disposed.
