[Colors/Fonts] [Presentation] Need to bind theme elements to presentations

Text of original email: We need to think about how the default presentation (and colors/fonts it relies on) are packaged with workbench. As it stands, the default (and native) factories are declared in the org.eclipse.ui plugin along with the workbench colors/fonts. The problem is that the workbench colors/fonts were designed to work with the default presentation. As such, if a person is using a presentation other than default they still have to see all of the default workbench colors in the colors and fonts preference page. We can do several things here.... 1) break the presentations and their relevant colors into seperate plugins or fragments. This will help clarify the problem for RCP purposes but it wont prevent colors/fonts (maybe even categories) from appearing in the preference page. 2) add new elements to the themes extension point that bind fonts/colors/categories to presentations by ID. When the preference page is opened we filter out items that are not relevant. Omission of a binding would indicate the element is useful across all presentations (such as the Ant colors) I'm not sure if either of these things are necessary for 3.0... ideas/comments?
