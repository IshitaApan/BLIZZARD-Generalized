[Workbench] Create Browser says it accepts null but it fails with null pointer if you do.

/** 	 * Creates the new web browser instance. This is a simplified method that 	 * creates the instance using default values for style, name and tooltip 	 * parameters. The method can be used to quickly open the URL by calling 	 * <code>createBrowser(id).openURL(url)</code>. 	 * <p> 	 * 	 * @return the browser instance that can be used to open the URL. Clients 	 * intending to reuse the instance for all the URLs should cache the 	 * instance and call IWebBrowser#openURL() on it. Clients are 	 * responsible for closing the browser instance when not needed. 	 * @exception PartInitException 	 * if the operation failed for some reason 	 */ 	IWebBrowser createBrowser(String browserId) throws PartInitException; 	 	The createBrowser method has the following documentation: 	 	 * @param browserId 	 * if an instance of a browser with the same id is already 	 * opened, it will be returned instead of creating a new one. 	 * Passing <code>null</code> will create a new instance with a 	 * generated id every time. 	 	However whenever I pass null I get a null pointer exception on the create call. This was in code that worked in 3.2. Once I changed the code to pass in the url as the browser id it started working fine.
