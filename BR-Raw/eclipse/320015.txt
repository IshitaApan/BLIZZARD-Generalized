new look - toolbar and persp switcher issues

based on a 6/15 win7 screenshot review and a 7/7 multiplatform screenshot review by Linda. These are the issues flagged that are still true (many were already fixed.) Note I don't see that these are critical for ship, but if it's a matter of stylesheet or layout tweak for some of them, I will attempt.... - global toolbar should be 32 pixels high from top of gradient to bottom keyline - global toolbar items should be faded to 50% opacity - gutter space between bottom of global toolbar and top of panes should be 32 pixels high - Mac only - why is the perspective switcher not the same as in other platforms?
