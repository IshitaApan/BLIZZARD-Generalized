If DS is not included in the launch config a warning should be issued

If the ds bundle is not in the launch config a NPE is created the first time a service is used. Tom Schindl suggested on the e4 mailing list that the existance of the ds bundles should be checked at start time and a warning should be written if they are not included in the launch config.
