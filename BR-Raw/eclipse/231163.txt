[ErrorHandling] WorkbenchStatusDialogManager shouldn't hold onto parentShell

The discussion in bug #229668 has led us to the conclusion that its a design error for WorkbenchStatusDialogManager to hold onto parentShell, because WorkbenchStatusDialogManager is long lived and in practice the shell needs to be the topmost modal dialog's which isn't known at time of construction/setting. The presence of the parentShell field is really a hold over from the class' earlier life as a dialog. During the refactoring it should've been removed. WorkbenchStatusDialogManager is new in 3.4. To effect this change, its two constructors will need to be modified to remove the Shell argument. The following: public WorkbenchStatusDialogManager(Shell parentShell, int displayMask, 			String dialogTitle) public WorkbenchStatusDialogManager(Shell parentShell, String dialogTitle) become: public WorkbenchStatusDialogManager(int displayMask, String dialogTitle) public WorkbenchStatusDialogManager(String dialogTitle)
