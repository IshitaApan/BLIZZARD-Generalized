[Themes] PerspectiveBarManager accesses JFaceResources.fontRegistry directly as oppsed to the current theme

M8 All workbench color/font retrieval should be done through the current theme. Additionally, it tries to obtain a font "SMALL_FONT" which has never been declared in the registry. If this font is needed then a definition should be added to org.eclipse.ui/plugin.xml or another value should be reused (the view message font perhaps? It was intended that this would be a "small font" originally.)
