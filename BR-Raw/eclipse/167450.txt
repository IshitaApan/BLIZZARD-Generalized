[DataBinding] Get rid of bind support factory magic

I finally realized that we don't need that other magic factory. I'll move fillBindSpecDefaults() and the methods it calls (createConverter, createValidator etc) to a new class DefaultBindSpec. Clients who want default validators and converters created for them just create a DefaultBindSpec as opposed to a (rather empty) BindSpec. I will also move the early type checking into DefaultBindSpec to make it optional as well.
