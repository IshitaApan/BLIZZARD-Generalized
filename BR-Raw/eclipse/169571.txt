[Presentations] CTabFolder should not use the ellipsis

M4 The CTabFolder is losing too much information by trying to shorten with an ellipsis. I will attach a patch that no longer uses it and also removes the image later. The use of the ellipsis meant that useful title information was being removed too soon - we just not using it we retain more information. We also had too large of a minimum image width so we were removing the image width before we needed to. Kelvin, McQ and Kevin - we looked into using the image instead of text when the tab got small and it turns out that the current implementation is the most sensible. The image is only removed if there is no space to show it. In that case we use whatever text we can in that space. The only thing worth changing was the margin added for determining minimum space required for the image- it was large enough that you never got the image without text case. I will apply a patch.
