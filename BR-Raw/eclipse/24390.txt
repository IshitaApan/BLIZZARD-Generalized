[Welcome] Ctrl+Tab should tab out of the welcome page

build 2001001 Ctrl+Tab currently tabs to the next text widget/paragraph in a welcome page. This is not the appropriate behavior from a user point of view. The user considers the welcome page as one entity and doesn't care that it is made up of multiple StyledText widgets. If you ctrl+tab in IE it gets you out of the page and to the next IE widget (the link combo box). The welcome editor should behave the same, ctrl+tab should take you out of the editor immediately.
