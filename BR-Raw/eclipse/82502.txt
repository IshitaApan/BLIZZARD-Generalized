[Markers] tasklist entries not showing up consistently

In the WebSphere Business Integration Message Broker toolkit, we use markers to add to the tasklist warnings and errors that associated with IResources. We have noticed that some of the warnings were not showing up when using the "on any resource in same project" filtering option. The problem was very visible when we select all the tasklist entries that are shown, and we compare the numbers showing at the very bottom ("9 items selected: 0 errors, 9 warnings, 0 infos") of the main application window, with the numbers shown just under "Problems" "0 errors, 11 warnings, 0 infos (Filter matched 11 of 29 items". If I change the filtering to "on selected Resource only", then the problem disappears. This problem is breaking our autofix feature that needs to have all warnings and errors available. I have a screen capture if it makes things easiar.
