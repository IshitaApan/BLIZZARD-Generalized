Project info property page should not include "derived" property

Build 20020430 1) Right click on a project, Properties->Info 2) Check off the "derived" check box. Click ok. 3) Go back to the properties page. The box is not checked. The Core API states that it ignores the derived bit for projects, so this option should not even appear on the info property page for projects. Note: it might also be useful to give a one line description of what this means, as it won't be a familiar concept for most users. Something like, "Hint to repository providers that this resource should not be shared with other users."
