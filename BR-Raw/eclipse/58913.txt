ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: ------------------- + No package overview IDeferredWorkbenchAdapter + marked as experimental and subject to change. Is this intentional? + Give a concrete example of how it is used + in "fetchDeferredChildren", "should return notify" makes no sense + what should the implementors do if the progress monitor is cancelled? + what is object? What possible things could I expect it to be? can this be null? + can collector be null? + in "isContainer", the @returns sentence doesn't make sense. what rule? + in "getRule", can object be null? + can the scheduling rule be null? + the scheduling rule is obviously an instance of ISchedulingRule DeferredTreeContentManager + in "DeferredTreeContentManager(provider,viewer,site)", no param doc + in "DeferredTreeContentManager(provider,viewer)", no param doc + mayHaveChildren is missing param doc + mayHaveChildren should use @throws instead of commenting in the method doc + mayHaveChildren returns boolean? thanks. + getChildren second sentence is not grammatically correct + in general, this class is missing real information in param/returns. either there's nothing or things like "returns Object[]". it's also nice to be explicit about null vs. not null vs. possibly empty. + "startFetchingDeferredChildren" - "retrieve" should be "retrieved" + "runClearPlaceholderJob" why would I want to do this? what does it mean? + in general, element collector is bit foggy. one or two sentences in the class summary would help (providing a link for more info). This is a work in progress. More stuff to appear over the weekend.
