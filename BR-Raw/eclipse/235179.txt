[GlobalActions] Help/Tips and Tricks menu is missing

I20080530-0100 Start Eclipe Open the Help Menu Expected Result: Tips and tricks is on the Help Menu Actual Result: Tips and tricks is missing This works fine in Eclipse 3.3.2, it seems to have been missing for some time in Eclipse 3.4. Note that Help/Tips and Tricks is initiated by TipsAndTricksAction from org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide (or was in 3.3). Testing tips and tricks is not part of the UA test plan which is why this was not detected earlier, I'm not sure which component owns this code but my guess is that something changed in org.eclipse.ui.ide to cause this menu to stop showing.
