[RCP] Need separate API for showing fast view bars and perspective bar

build I20040219 In the new look, the shortcut bar on the left has been broken up into fast view bars (which can be at left, right and/or bottom [there are ongoing changes here]) and the perspective bar (at top right). IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer.get/setShowShortcutBar(boolean) should be broken up into separate methods get/setShowFastViewBars(boolean) and get/setShowPerspectiveBar(boolean). The corresponding preference constants in IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants need to be added as well.
