[IDE] Own view (source) is not listed in "Show In" menu when explicitly requested by IShowInTargetList

In some cases, it makes sense to have the view where "Show In" is invoked as target in the "Show In" menu itself. One such case is in EGit with the history view. When viewing the changed files of a commit and there is a deleted file, one may want to view the history of that file before it was deleted. In that case, Show In > History would make sense, see bug 348601. In general, it doesn't make sense, but for specific cases, it would be nice if this could be requested. One way to do that would be to explicitly list the view in IShowInTargetList. But even then, the own view is currently filtered. The code which filters the targets is in ShowInMenu#getViewDescriptors. Moving it to getShowInPartIds would allow to change the behavior to only filter it before adding the targets from IShowInTargetList. I can provide a patch, but the question to answer before that is: Is this change in behavior acceptable?
