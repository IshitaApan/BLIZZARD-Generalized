[Workbench] Improve startup performance by fixing the cache for feature ini's

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #75130 +++ Build ID: Eclipse SDK 3.6m6 We have done extensive measurement of startup performance on our product built on Eclipse, and we found that re-reading feature ini's on startup costs 2 seconds on cold start right after reboot. This is 5% of our measured 40 second total cold start time. The actual performance hit depends on the number of features installed in a product. On a plain Eclipse SDK, the improvement is smaller (because there are less features), but it is still observeable. We have found that in order to improve performance, a cache for feature ini's has actually been implemented with bug 75130 a long while ago - but the original fix is not 100% correct: In case the quick start is not shown, this fact is not persisted in the preferences, and the optimization does not work. This is because 'IPreferenceStore.setValue(quickstartKey, false)' clears the preference setting because the default value is false. We have attached the very simple and straightforward fix is in bug 75130 attachment 164820. Given that M7 is supposed to be a performance milestone, is there a chance getting this into 3.6M7?
