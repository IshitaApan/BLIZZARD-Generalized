RAServer process dies occasionally

Consuming product playback fails about 1/7 times due to RAServer process gone. While not sure, I think the process disappears at the end of one run as opposed to the start of a new run. Will attach a zip file with a log from the run (product symptom is "timeout" of run) and servicelog.log. This log is default settings. Unfortunately through 20 or so runs was unable to get a failure with level HIGH and DEBUG.
