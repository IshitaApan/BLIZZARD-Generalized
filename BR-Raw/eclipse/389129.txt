Progress view background incorrect on 4.2

Created attachment 220873 What the progress view looks like with no jobs running (with console for comparison) The progress view in Eclipse 4.2 is rendered with a grey background. However, the background of the Eclipse theme is white in 4.2, so this stands out like a sore thumb. Furthermore, when jobs are running in Eclipse the background is shown as white. So depending on whether jobs are running or not, you get an alternating grey/white background. This behaviour is seen on both OSX and Windows, so it's not a platform-specific bug.
