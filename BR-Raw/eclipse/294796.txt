[Contributions] API request: LegacyActionTools#escapeMnemonics(String)

Created attachment 151874 implementation HEAD API request: LegacyActionTools#escapeMnemonics(String). This would be helpful in situations similar to LegacyActionTools#removeMnemonics(String), but where the unmodified string is required. The patch also updates usages in Platform/UI.
