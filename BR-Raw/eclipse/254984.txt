[Progress] IWorkbenchSiteProgressService's schedule(Job, long, boolean) method ignores third parameter after the first call

Created attachment 117624 Sample ViewPart to reproduce the problem. IWorkbenchSiteProgressService's schedule(Job, long, boolean) method spec's that the third boolean argument is for specifying whether a "half busy" mouse cursor should be used or not while the job is being run. However, this boolean parameter is actually only honoured on the first call (or the first call to schedule(Job) or schedule(Job, long), which uses 'false' as the parameter). Subsequent calls will ignore this parameter completely. The implementation method in WorkbenchSiteProgressService is like so... public void schedule(Job job, long delay, boolean useHalfBusyCursor) { job.addJobChangeListener(getJobChangeListener(job, useHalfBusyCursor)); job.schedule(delay); } ...and getJobChangeListener(Job, boolean) looks like so... public IJobChangeListener getJobChangeListener(final Job job, boolean useHalfBusyCursor) { if (listener == null) { updateJob.useWaitCursor = useHalfBusyCursor; listener = new JobChangeAdapter() { /* code commented out */ }; } return listener; } ...so as you can see, after the job listener has been created by the first invocation of the schedule method, the parameter is no longer read and the service's updateJob is stuck with the boolean flag that was set by the first invocation. Please see the attached ViewPart subclass of some sample code that demonstrates the problem. Once you click one of the two buttons, you will notice that clicking the other one will not alter the cursor state as you might expect.
