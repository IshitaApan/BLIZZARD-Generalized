[Preferences] Preferences.OK should be in a SafeRunnable.

1. I downloaded the latest integration build (200405060200) 2. Updated to org.eclipse.jdt.cheetah04 (0.0.4). 3. Upon restart, I imported a .java file with generic class and generic methods, to test generic usage in Eclipse. 4. I went into the preferences menu, and selected Java/Compiler. On the Compliance and Classfiles page I chose Compiler compliance level: 1.5. I pressed the "Apply" button and the "OK" button is immediatly highlighted. I press the "OK" button and the button lights up as if the command is recieved but does nothing (preference pane remains open). The only way to exit is to press the "Cancel" button or to close the window. Expected Results: Expected source to recompile file and remove source errors. Actual Results: Forced to close preference window, applying source change to 1.5 has no effect.
