[RCP] [Help] Help action fails silently if Help UI not installed

If the dependencies <import plugin="org.eclipse.help"/> <import plugin="org.eclipse.help.ui"/> <import plugin="org.eclipse.help.webapp"/> <import plugin="org.eclipse.tomcat"/> are not stated in plugin.xml, the help system won't work, there is no explanation why it won't. Reproduce by downloading Ed Burnett's org.eclipse.ui.tutorial.rcp.part3 and run it according to his instructions in http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7echeckout%7e/org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part3/html/tutorial3.html Then delete the above mentioned entries in plugin.xml, do run - debug - plug-ins and "deselect all", select "org.eclipse.ui.tutorials.rcp.part3" and "add required plug-ins". There is no indication why help won't work now. Without Ed's tutorial it is difficult to find out the needed dependencies (debug the source code?).
