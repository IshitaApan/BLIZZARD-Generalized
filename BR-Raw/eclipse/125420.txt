[Commands] parameters: allow commands to specify return type

Bug #121709 established a system for command parameter types. There was a request (from UA for cheatsheets) to augment this a bit to allow the return type of a command to be (optionally) specified also. I'm going to attach a patch providing this support. The <command> element will get a new attribute called returnTypeId that is used to specify a commandParameterType id (just as with the <commandParameter> element's typeId attribute). The existing JUnit tests for command parameter types were updated to use/test this new functionality. Two questions: 1) should the return type be considered in Command#compareTo()? 2) should the return type affect eventing in Command#define() and Command#undefine() The patch assumes "no" to those questions. I can work on the patch more if the answer is yes.
