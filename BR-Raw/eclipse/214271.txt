[CommonNavigator] Undo/redo not enabled if nothing selected

Build ID: M20071023-1652 Steps To Reproduce: I am doing an RCP application using the 3.3.1 version of the CommonNavigator (I have not tried 3.4 yet). I have a problem with undo/redo enablement, which is easily duplicated: 1) Create a file, using the project explorer (or whatever your CommonNavigator view is) 2) You should see the undo button enabled. 3) Then clear the selection (make sure there are no resources selected) in the project explorer. The undo button will incorrectly no longer be enabled. More information: This is probably also related to bug 190571. I have tracked this down to the fact that the UndoRedoActionGroup is part of the RefactorActionProvider, and that the RefactorActionProvider is only enabled when there is a resource selected. I have worked around this by making my own action provider which contains only the UndoRedoActionGroup, and setting this up to be enabled all the time, using this markup (directly under the "extension" element, not under the "navigatorContent" element): <!-- see notes in UnfoRedoActionProvider about this --> <actionProvider class="com.oaklandsw.gui.UndoRedoActionProvider" id="com.oaklandsw.gui.UndoRedoActions"> <enablement> <not> <systemTest property="org.eclipse.core.runtime.product" value="XXX"/> </not> </enablement> </actionProvider>
