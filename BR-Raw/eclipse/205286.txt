[ViewMgmt] Icons from one view's toolbar appear in another view

Using I20070925-1406, I got a weird behavior when I opened the hierarchy view from the java editor using F4. My steps so far are: 1) Have a java project loaded in the java perspective. 2) Open a java editor 3) From the java perspective, inside the java editor select a type name 4) Make sure the hierarchy view is closed. 5) Make sure that the two icons for "link with editor" and "collapse all" are on the "first" line. 6) Press F4 to open the hierarchy view. 7) The two icons mentionned before appear in the hierarchy view. 8) If you resize the java editor, they stay on top of it. Saying this, I could not reproduce it anymore, but I got it several times. If I can get exactly what is missing to reproduce it all the time, I'll update this bug report.
