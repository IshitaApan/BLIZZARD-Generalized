[IDE] Prompt when clearing executable attribute on folders

This is split from bug 109979. On Unix platforms, removing the executable bit from a directory means that the directory contents can no longer be listed. In Eclipse, this is manifested by the children being deleted from the Eclipse workspace (Note: the children are NOT deleted from the file system). This can be very alarming for the user because it appears they have lost work. The property page that allows the executable bit to be changed should prompt for confirmation when it is changed on a directory (org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.dialogs.ResourceInfoPage). Since the exact behaviour may vary across platforms, I suggest something like: "Removing the executable attribute from a folder may cause the contents of that folder to be unreadable, resulting in the appearance that those contents have been deleted. Are you sure you want to do this?"
