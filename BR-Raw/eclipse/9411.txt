WorkbenchPart.setInitializationData not safe (leaks)

The API does not specify that this method can be called only once. If it is called more than once then the image is not disposed. Either the method's API should state that it is not safe to call the method twice or (better) the code should be fixed to allow multiple calls. This is preferred because there is no API to reset the title and the title image to the values specified in plugin.xml.
