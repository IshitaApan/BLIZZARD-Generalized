[Linked Resources] Copy/move linked resources and existing resources

build 20021218 When copying or moving linked resources on top of existing resources the existing resources are not actually replaced with the linked resources. Instead, file content is set to that of the linked resources and folders are merged. Files could just be overwritten, however overwriting folders would require a new/different warning message to make it clear that folders will not be merged but instead deleted and replaced with the linked folder. The other direction, overwriting linked resources with regular ones, has the same problem. The linked resource should be deleted first and the regular one copied/moved. The unexpected file copying behavior is the result of the validateEdit/setContents changes. When linked resources are involved we should not use validateEdit/setContents.
