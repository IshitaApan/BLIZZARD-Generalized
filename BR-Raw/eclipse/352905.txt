[Compatibility] 'Quick Outline' disappears if opened after opening an editor

I frequently do the following actions when browsing code: 1. F3 or Ctrl-Shift-T to open a class declaration 2. ^O to bring up a quick outline 3. <type chars> to bring up a particular method With 3.x I could do these actions quickly without waiting for the editor to open. With 4.x somehow the Quick Outline disappears and the characters I type type over the class name. In fact I find that I really need to pause and wait between steps (1) and (2). Otherwise it will seem to work (that is, the editor will open and the Quick Outline window pops up), but before I can type in any characters the Quick Outline window will disappear. I mentioned this to Remy on IRC, and he suspected the following: [13:51:10] <rcjsuen> I just tried that but looks like F3 took so long the Ctrl+O and the characters did nothing [14:21:53] <briandealwis> rcjsuen: Oops, sorry, got distracted. Did the ^O come up with the your characters? Or were the characters put into the editor instead? [14:28:49] <rcjsuen> briandealwis: no in this case Ctrl+O didn't happen [14:28:55] <rcjsuen> i think it got eaten while the progress dialog was up (processing F3)
