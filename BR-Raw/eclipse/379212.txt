IPerspectiveListener3.perspectiveOpened is not called on opening a new perspective

Build Identifier: Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I20120315-1300 After I opened new perspective by using the "open perspective" button IPerspectiveListener3.perspectiveOpened was not called.Same for IPerspectiveListener3.perspectiveClosed if closing the perspective.These worked fine for older eclipse versions such as 3.7. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: I have the following simple code fragment: IWorkbenchWindow workbechWindow = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow(); workbechWindow.addPerspectiveListener(new IPerspectiveListener3(){ ... public void perspectiveOpened(IWorkbenchPage page, IPerspectiveDescriptor perspective) { System.out.println("Inside perspective open"); } ... });
