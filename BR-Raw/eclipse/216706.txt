[Viewers] Disable 'check for expiration of doubleClickTime' in TreeViewer and TableViewer

I use the TextCellEditor within the TreeViewer and TableViewer. When clicking on a cell to edit it the full text is selected (on win and gtk at least). At this point if I immediately click again (to position the cursor at a specific point within the text) the edit is cancelled. If I wait a bit before clicking again then the cursor is repositioned as expected. You could reproduce it by using the Tasks view. I guess the following code in TreeViewerImpl and TableViewerImpl is responsible for this behaviour: -------------------- snip -------------------------- private void activateCellEditor() { ... mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() { public void mouseDown(MouseEvent e) { // time wrap? // check for expiration of doubleClickTime if (e.time <= doubleClickExpirationTime) { control.removeMouseListener(mouseListener); cancelEditing(); handleDoubleClickEvent(); } else if (mouseListener != null) { control.removeMouseListener(mouseListener); } } }; control.addMouseListener(mouseListener); ... } -------------------- snap -------------------------- So clicking the second time within the doubleClickExpirationTime cancels editing. Is it possible to add a flag to disable this behaviour, or to remove it completely?
