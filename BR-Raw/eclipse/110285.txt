[WorkbenchParts] New API EditorPart.setInputWithNotify needs clarification

I20050921-2000 In 3.2 new protected EditorPart.setInputWithNotify(IEditorInput) has been introduced and the existing method EditorPart.setInput(IEditorInput) has been deprecated. I see the following problems with this - there's no caller of this API in the SDK and so far no request on the mailing lists describing to clients how to adopt it - what are subclasses (who themselves are allowed to be subclassed) of EditorPart supposed to do if they want to extend/override setting of the input? Do they always have implement the new and the deprecated method (since there's no backward compatibility code)? - what is now the intent of IReusableEditor.setInput(IEditorInput)? Is it EditorPart.setInput(...) or EditoPart.setInputWithNotify(...)?
