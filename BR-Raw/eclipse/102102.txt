[Import/Export] build running after each imported project

With the new Import Existing Projects dialog, it would appear that if you select multiple projects to import, the workspace actually imports them one at a time which kicks off a build after each import. To reproduce: Ensure that auto-build is turned on Open the Import Existing Projects dialog Select a root folder containing a number (10 or so) of existing projects Select all projects to import, then click Finish Notice that the "User Operation is Waiting" dialog should appear indicating that an Import job, followed by a Refresh Workspace job are waiting for a Building Workspace job. A quick glance over at the (slowly) populating Navigator shows that this seems to happen for each project being imported. For the sake of performance, I would recommend batching these imports together into one job and simply allowing one build to take place when they are all done.
