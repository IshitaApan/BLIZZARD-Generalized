Add ability to specify filter-path to build-options that support browsing

Build Identifier: 7.0.0.I201001150805 Currently, build-options of browseType "file"/"directory"/etc allow the user to browse the file-system, but do not give integrators a way to set the default filter-path. So, the Browse dialog by default opens at the root of the file-system. The attached patch adds a new optional attribute for the <option> element - "browseFilterPath". If the attribute is specified, the Browse dialog uses the supplied value as the default filter-path. Macros in the attribute value are expanded. If the attribute is not specified, the behaviour is unchanged. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new C Project. 2. Open the Settings property page, and find a build-option that has a "file" browseType (eg. libraries) or a "directory" browseType (eg. include-path). 3. Click on Add... button to add a new entry. 4. Click on Filesystem... to browse the file-system. -> The Browse dialog opens up at the root of the file-system by default.
