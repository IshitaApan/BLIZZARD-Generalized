[Wizards] A primary INewWizard does not show up if it's the only INewWizard and uncategorized

If an INewWizard is uncategorized and is the only wizard in the RCP application, and is also a primary wizard, then it does not show up in the wizard selection in the NewWizard wizard. The cause of this seems to be the assumption by the org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.WizardContentProvider that if there's only one item in the children of the AdaptablesList, it must be a wizard category (WizardCollectionElement) and wants to return all it's children. But when all the wizards are primary, it seems the categories are not used, and the content provider is trying to return the children of the wizard (WorkbenchWizardElement), instead of returning the wizard itself. This sounds complicated, but I hope it made sense. The problematic place in 3.2 is // if there is only one category, return it's children directly (flatten list) if (list.size() == 1) { return getChildren(list.get(0)); } (lines 71-74) I'll attach a patch against the R3_2_maintenance branch
