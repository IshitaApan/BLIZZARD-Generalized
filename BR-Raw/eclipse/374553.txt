Part ToolBar is not re-rendered correctly when a ToolItem is hidden

Build Identifier: I20120314-2200 When hiding a tool item the toolbar is not rendered correctly. In my example there are two tool items and the part menu. When I hide ToolItem 2 the part menu moves to the left next to ToolItem 1. There is a bunch of space between the part menu and the edge of the part. I would have expected ToolItem 1 to move closer to the part menu. See attachments Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a Part with two ToolItems and a part menu 2. Hide the ToolItem closest to the part menu 3. The ToolBar will refresh and the part menu will move to the right.
