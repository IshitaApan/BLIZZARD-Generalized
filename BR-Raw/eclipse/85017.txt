[KeyBindings] preference page: Hang in "org/eclipse/swt/internal/gtk/OS._gtk_tree_view_column_cell_get_size"

I20040209-0800, GTK+ 2.4.14, KDE 3.3.1, X.Org 6.8.0, Linux 2.6.10, IBM JRE j9xia32142-20040826 I had the keys preference page open, and tried to select a context for the "when" combo box (bottom of the modify tab). There was no response from the system and repainting stopped.
