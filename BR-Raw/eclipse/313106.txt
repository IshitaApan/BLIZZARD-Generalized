[CommonNavigator] Regression: Show In > Project Explorer removes selection after setting it

N20100516-2000, broken since 3.6 M7, works in R3.5.x. First Show In > Project Explorer removes selection after setting it. 1. start with new workspace 2. switch to 'Resource' perspective 3. close the 'Project Explorer' 4. open the 'Navigator' 5. create a simple project 'P' 6. Navigate > Show In > Project Explorer ==> selection is set in the 'Project Explorer' but immediately removed afterwards Should fix for 3.6 since Show In > is broken
