Change GenTopic so that only Interface definitions from the model are generated

Eric pointed out that as we move forward with other kinds of life cycle events, there will be a need for several publish methods. (One patch I submitted had the method in ModelServiceImpl where it was used by brintToTop). There are also several "static" kinds of methods being "generated" in UIEvents ... the build methods, and the non lifecycle events themselves come to mind. To make adding these methods easier than pasting in long strings of escaped Java text I suggest that we create a class E4Events.java and make UIEvents.java a subclass of it. Then we can move everything that is not truly generated up from UIEvents into E4Events.
