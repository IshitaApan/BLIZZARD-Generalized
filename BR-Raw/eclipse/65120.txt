[ActivityMgmt] triggering activity does not update view toolbar

RC1 * The java debugger contributes a "drop to frame" action in the debug view toolabr * Start a workspace * Debug a java application to a breakpoint -> debug view appears with drop to frame tool/action (correct) * terminate & remove launch * Close all perspectives * Turn off "Java Development" & "PDE" capabilities * Open debug perspective -> debug view appears with *no* drop to frame tool/action (correct) * re-debug the same app -> debug view does not update to show "drop to frame" action, but "Java Development" activity is triggered (see capability pref page to see that the capability has been triggered on) Would expect capability activation to update view toolbars. This is important to the debugger - as capabilities are triggered, the relevant debug actions should appear in debug related views. Resetting the perspective does not correct the problem either.
