[Undo] new file creation subjec to Undo (file deleted without warning)

when creating a new file by right clicking on your project in the project explorer new->file this action is put on the undo/redo stack. Pressing Ctrl-Z to undo this action will thus delete your file. As this stack is separate from the stack in the editor , one can create a new file, work for a long time, then inadvertently press ctrl-z to undo a code change while having the focus on the project explorer and irrevocably lose their file. Redo will create a new EMPTY file; the work is gone, forever. This appears to only work for the "new file", not for "new->source file" etc. Although some may perceive this as a feature, it is hard to imagine a scenario where ctrl-z should permanently delete a file without warning.
