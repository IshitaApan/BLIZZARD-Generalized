An IContributionManagerOverrides's getVisible(*) method is called 2k-10k times

While looking at the performance problem behind bug 320478, I have noticed that the getVisible(*) method is called 2k-10k times in 4.x when switching between active parts. This number is less than 100 in 3.x and only goes into the hundreds when you switch perspectives.
