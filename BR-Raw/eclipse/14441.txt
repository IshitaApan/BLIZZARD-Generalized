[Tasks] Selective disabling of compiler or enhanced filtering in task view

In large projects, many times there are individual Java files, entire packages and sometimes even entire branches of the source tree that will not compile for one reason or the other. From a particular developer's point of view that may or may not be a problem. However, the (potentially) large numbers of errors that the developer does not care about still clutters up the errors in the task view that he/she really cares about. It would be nice to have a capability to either mark individual Java file(s), or packages or parts of the source-tree to mean "do not compile and/or report errors". Alternatively, filtering of the task view could be enhanced to ignore errors from multiple unrelated Java file (s), or packages (currently, the choice is limited to either the selected resource or ALL errors from the selected project). In a discussion about this on the Eclipse newsgroup, it was mentioned that the source could be partitioned in a different way to allow current Exlipse functionality to do the filtering. But, in cases where the source tree already exists in a large (open source, say) project, such reorganization is often not possible. Another workaround mentioned was to root each part of the source tree individually, which might work in certain cases, but quickly becomes tedious as the number of branches of the src tree increases.
