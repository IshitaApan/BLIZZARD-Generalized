[ViewMgmt] [RCP] Allow zoom out behavior for view stacks to be more like editor stacks.

We have cases where we would not like the zoomed state of a view stack to zoom out when a new view is opened or closed in the same stack. To reproduce: 1. launch the workbench 2. maximize the "Tasks" view 3. select the "Show view" menu and show the "Console" view. problem: the console view opens in the same stack that is zoomed, however the layout is still updated and the stack zooms out. Some users may expect behavior similar to the editor area, where the editor area does not zoom out when a new editor part is opened in the same editor stack. To demonstrate another valid use case for this, 1. install the rcp browser demo example plug-in 2. change the plugin.xml such that the perspective is not fixed 3. show the history view 4. zoom the browser view 5. show another browser view via File | New Tab problem: the stack zooms out, showing the history view again, this seems jarring to the end user.
