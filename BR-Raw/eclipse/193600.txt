[Commands] org.eclipse.ui.menus/menuContribution locationURI query placement "endof=..." not implemented?

Build id: I20070608-1718 According to the specification of org.eclipse.ui.menus/menuContribution/separator, the query placement "endof=..." should be support in the locationURI: see the description of the na,e attribute below. <!ELEMENT separator EMPTY> <!ATTLIST separator name CDATA #REQUIRED visible (true | false) > Inserts a separator at the current insertion point. name - The 'id' of this contribution. If defined then it can be used as a reference in the Query part of the location defining whether the additions are to go before or after this element (or at the end of the logical group containing this element using the 'endOf' value). Separator contributions that have an id define the start of a logical group so the result of using the 'endof' value for placement is to search forward in the current menu to locate the next id'd separator and to place the inserted elements before that element. If no trailing separator is found then the items are placed at the end of the menu. visible - Indicates whether or not the separator should be visible in the UI. false by default.
