[Forms] Eclipse 3.4 crashes / failes to repaint when "Close Others" is used with SharedHeaderFormEditor

Steps to reproduce: 1. Open 5 form-based Mylyn task editor 2. Use Close Others Result on Windows: Eclipse sometimes fails to repaint the gradients of sections or the SharedHeaderFormEditor that is still open. When the editor is resized or Eclipse is minimized/maximized the problem fixes itself. This symptoms are same as the ones described on bug 218412. Result on Linux: The program 'Eclipse' received an X Window System error. This probably reflects a bug in the program. The error was 'BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)'. (Details: serial 187174 error_code 4 request_code 56 minor_code 0) (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously; that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it. To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.) Result on Mac OS X: The open SharedHeaderFormEditor does not refresh anymore and stays blank until closed. Eclipse version: I20080530-1730 (3.4RC3). I can not reproduce this problem with Eclipse 3.3. I am unsure whether this problem is caused by Mylyn or if this is a bug in platform but I noticed that the way resources are shared between form-based editors has changed in 3.4 (bug 200690, bug 202474) which might be related. This bug is a blocker for the Mylyn 3.4RC4 release. I'd be happy to provide more details or do further debugging if anyone can provide pointers where to look next.
