[Viewers] [JFace] setUseHashLookUp() and multiple occurrences of same domain object in TreeViewer

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: If a domain object appears twice or more in a TreeViewer, client code must call viewer.setUseHashLookUp(true) so that viewer.update(domain_object, null) refreshes all occurrences, instead of only the first found. This behavior is not documented in the javadoc for either setUseHashLookUp() or update() ! More information: Using setUseHashLookUp(true) seems to be a side effect since this method's javadoc only refers its use for speed optimization. Otherwise, the javadoc should be updated to reflect this important feature. As such, I think there should be update() and refresh() methods accepting elements or treepaths, in the same way there is add(Object parentElementOrTreePath, ...) and remove(Object[] elementsOrTreePaths). Also, having an update(Object[] elementsOrTreePaths) would improve the speed of finding the right internal widget when TreePaths are given. Having these new methods (or revising the current ones) would also make the API more consistent than it is now.
