[KeyBindings] Some key bindings don't appear in menus when Eclipse first started

When Eclipse is opened without an editor open, some key bindings are not initialized. Losing and restoring focus on the window seems to set all of the bindings. Opening Eclipse with an editor already open seems to set all the bindings as well. STEPS TO REPRODUCE: 1.) Open Eclipse with no editors open. (If editors are open, then close them all and restart Eclipse so that no editors start open). 2.) Open a Java source file. 3.) Look at the Source menu. Comment (amongst many others) is missing its key binding. 4.) Switch to a different application (i.e., deactivate the window, take focus away from the window). 5.) Return focus to the window. 6.) Look at the Source menu. Command has its key binding now. Opening Eclipse with an editor already open appears to correctly initialize the key bindings on the menus.
