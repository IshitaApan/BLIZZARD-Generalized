There are still some 'Discouraged Access' warnings for things that should be API

I've brought in the project that I used as the basis for my EclipseCon talk and there are still a few notifications against things that should be API at this point. Some of them are in packages that also appear to have non-API classes, we may decide to defer some of them but we should take what action we can. The most glaring is that the annotations needed to create a new part aren't API; these are in the org.eclipse.e4.ui.di bundle and include @Focus, @Persist, @UIEventTopic... In org.eclipse.e4.core.extensions there's the @Preference annotation but there are a couple of other classes that I'm not sure of (perhaps we can defer this one). The org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench package contains the UIEvents class which is needed to construct the topics for any model listening and should be API. Again, I'm not sure what the API status is of the other classes in this package. The rest of the code (Model classes...) looks fine...
