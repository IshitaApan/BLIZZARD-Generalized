[FieldAssist] Left and right arrow keys should work with open proposals list

I20060328-0010, worked in M5 In the Find/Replace dialog, enable regex, then type something into the Find field and invoke content assist. Pressing the left or right arrow key now closes the proposals popup. The list should not be closed, but the caret should be moved and the proposals should be recalculated for the new caret position.
