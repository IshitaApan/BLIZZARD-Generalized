[Mac] window hard to resize

Created attachment 77350 this shows the laptop screen with the top of the window not visible. I had Eclipse 3.3.0 open on a very large external monitor on my MacBook. I quit Eclipse and restarted later when I had a different, much smaller external monitor. The app window appeared on my laptop screen however the top of the window was not visible or draggable. It took a while to notice that the top right of the window title bar was visible in the external monitor. I am including three images to show this issue: EclipseScreenSnapz002.png: this shows the laptop screen with the top of the window not visible. FinderScreenSnapz001.png: this shows the a small portion of the top right of the window was visible (and draggable) on the smaller external monitor. System PreferencesScreenSnapz001.png: This shows the relative sizes and positions of the second setup (MacBook Pro and smaller external monitor.
