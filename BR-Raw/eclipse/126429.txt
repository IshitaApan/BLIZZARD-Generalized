[ActivityMgmt] Activities should allow default enablement to be controlled by product definition

When composing a product out of various Eclipse distributions, such as Eclipse Platform SDK and WebTools, it is often desirable to control which activities are enabled by default in order to create an initial product experience that's less overwhelming and more relevant to the product usecases. Currently, if the someone (like the author of the activity) turns on default enablement via the <defaultEnablement> element of the org.eclipse.ui.activities extension point, there is nothing that the end-product can do to change that. It would be very useful to be able to override default enablement for activities via product properties (IProduct.getProperty()). Can this be addressed in the 3.2 timeframe? I can help (provide a patch) if needed.
