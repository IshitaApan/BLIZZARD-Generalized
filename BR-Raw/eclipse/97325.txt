[KeyBindings] [RCP] Key bindings for outline and properties views refer to IDE command

3.1 RC1 If the org.eclipse.ui.views plug-in is included in an RCP app, it generates the following log entries: !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 2 0 2005-05-30 13:32:14.840 !MESSAGE Warnings while parsing the key bindings from the 'org.eclipse.ui.commands' extension point !SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.ui 2 0 2005-05-30 13:32:14.850 !MESSAGE Cannot bind to an undefined command: plug-in='org.eclipse.ui.views', commandId='org.eclipse.ui.views.showView'. !SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.ui 2 0 2005-05-30 13:32:14.860 !MESSAGE Cannot bind to an undefined command: plug-in='org.eclipse.ui.views', commandId='org.eclipse.ui.views.showView'. The views plug-in provides the Outline and Properties views, and is intended to be "RCP-ready". Since org.eclipse.ui.ide already has a dependency on the views plug-in, I suggest simply moving the keybindings to the ide plug-in.
