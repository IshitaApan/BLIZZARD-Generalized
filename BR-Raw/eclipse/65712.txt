Activities - show all checkbox

I don't think the Show All checkbox in the New Project Wizard should maintain state. Assuming no activities are on, when the user initially enters this page he needs to check that checkbox to find the wizard he is looking for. Once he hits the next button the activity for that wizard is automatically enabled. The next time the user comes back to the new wizrd every wizard is enabled because the Show All Checkbox is on. Now the user needs to hunt for the wizard (even if it is the same one used above). Hopefully the activity enabled in the previous step correctly anticipate the next wizard the user is likely to need and thus it would be enabled. Thus we are taking a step backwards by forcing the user to still hunt through the entire list. I don't think the user is ever going to turn off that show all checkbox; I know I never remember to; nor do I want to be bothered by it.
