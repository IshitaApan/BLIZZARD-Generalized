Eclipse doesn't enforce user to enter the path to the workspace

Problem Description: Eclipse doesn't enforce user to enter the path to the workspace. You may complete the following steps to reproduce this scenario: 1. Launch Eclipse for the first time or delete the current workspace and configurations directory except “config.ini” file. Workspace Launcher Dialog is displayed. “<install location>\eclipse\workspace” is initially given in the “Workspace” field. 2. Hit the Backspace Key to remove the default path from the “Workspace” filed. The path to the workspace is empty now. 3. Click on OK button. Expected Behavior: Error message is displayed stating that the location of the workspace must be specified. Workspace Launcher Dialog should remain opened until a valid path is given. Actual Behavior: Workspace Launcher Dialog is dismissed and then the Eclipse Workbench is launched. “<install location>/eclipse” directory is used as the workspace.
