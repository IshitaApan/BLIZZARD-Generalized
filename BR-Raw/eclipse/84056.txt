[Contexts] Next/Previous Editor/View/Perspective does not work

This bug is specific for my system, as it works on another system. Pressing F6 brings up the "next editor" box, but I cannot step further than one entry, and cannot change to the selected editor. This happens with editors, views and perspectives. Error does not depend on VM (1.5.0 and 1.4.1 checked). No errors displayed in console. Reproducable in both GTK and Motif versions. I am running build eclipse.buildId=I200411050810 on a SuSE Linux 8.2 (i586) Kernel 2.4.20-64GB-SMP / i686 (which is a rather outdated version, about two years old or so) Please advice on required information about system libs, where I assume the problem to originate from. As the bug is a show stopper (for me), I assume it is rare and updating libraries will help, so please advice on possible candidates that I might try updating. Thank you.
