[Viewers] Document usability of IColorProvider, IFontProvider not usable for ListViewers

This week I had this 2 times. Users complaint that IColorProvider and IFontProvider are not working for their ListViewer. I'd like to mention this in the JavaDoc. Question is where the best place for this would be: - in the interfaces itself - in AbstractListViewer#setLabelProvider() or in both places?
