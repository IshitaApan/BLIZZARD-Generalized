[Editor Mgmt] No notification sent when an IEditorReference is closed

There doesn't appear to be any notification sent from the platform when an editor reference is closed. I don't get part closed notifications for editors which are restored at startup by the platform but are never activated by the user (thus, never fully instantiated). Background: I have an editor management view which displays open editors in a table. When the view is opened, I ask the workbench page for editor references and display these references in the table. I also listen to part open notifications to add newly opened editors to the view when their editor part is opened. Finally, I listen to part close notifications to remove editors from the table when they are closed. The problem is that if I don't get a notification from the platform, I don't know when to remove the editor from the view.
