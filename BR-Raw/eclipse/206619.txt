[Contributions] editor leaked when invoking action from visible action set via keybinding

I20071016-1215 - new workspace - Customize Perspective > Commands: select the "Team" group - bind "Apply Patch..." command to "Alt+Shift+P" - new simple project "P" - new file "f.txt" - in editor for f.txt, press Alt+Shift+P - press Esc to cancel - press Ctrl+W => Text editor is leaked: org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditor targetPart of org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.actions.ApplyPatchAction this$0 of org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.actions.TeamAction$1 [0] of java.lang.Object[3] listeners of org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList postListeners of org.eclipse.ui.internal.WindowSelectionService selectionService of org.eclipse.ui.internal.WWinPartService partService of org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow activeWorkbenchWindow of org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench [Stack Local] I've debugged it and found that TeamAction#init(IWorkbenchWindow) was called on two instances but TeamAction#dispose() was not called when the editor was closed, so it looks like a problem in Platform/UI.
