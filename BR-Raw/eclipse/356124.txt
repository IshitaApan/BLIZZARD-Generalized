[Compatibility] View is not displayed if added relative to a placeholder view

Build Identifier: I20110620-1631 If a perspective layout is designed such that the first view added to the IPageLayout is added using layout.addPlaceholder(...), when the perspective is displayed the perspective appears empty. If additional views are then added to the perspective, the views display as expected. Stepping through the perspective container hierarchy, it looks like the base PartSashContainer is not getting the toBeRendered flag set to true, although lower level PartSash/PartStacks do have the correct toBeRendered values. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an IPerspectiveFactory with the following createInitialLayout: public void createInitialLayout(final IPageLayout layout) { final String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea(); layout.setEditorAreaVisible(false); layout.addPlaceholder(<HiddenView>.ID, IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.5f, editorArea); layout.addView(<VisibleView>.ID, IPageLayout.RIGHT, 0.5f, <HiddenView>.ID); } 2. Open the created perspective and no views will display.
