[Show View] Dialog creates all view parts upon node expansion

Build ID: I20070621-1340 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Open the "Show View" Dialog 2. Expand the nodes 3. Watch all previously unopened views to be created More information: The ViewLabelProvider tries to paint unopened views by a dimmed colour in the treeview of the dialog. To do so it has to check whether a view is currently open or not. It uses IWorkbenchPage.findView to query opened views. However if the workbench contains views that have not been activated by the user yet (by clicking on the views tab) those views are "opened" now in the background by the findView method. This behaviour seems like a bug to me and findView should not call "createPart" in any way. Only openView should actually create view part controls.
