[Progress] Uncompleted monitor in class DummyJob

Created attachment 154239 Patch to complete the monitor In org.eclipse.ui.tests.progress.DummyJob, a progress monitor is used but the done() method is never called. According to the Javadoc, this article [1] and many other uses of monitors in Eclipse, the monitor should be completed with done() whenever a task is started with beginTask(). A patch that adds the missing call to done() is attached. [1] http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html#Ensure_to_always_complete_your_monitor
