[Dialogs] Add getMessage and getErrorMessage to TitleAreaDialogAPI

Build ID: I20090313-0100 Steps To Reproduce: I suggest the following methods for a TitleAreaDialog: setDialogComplete, getDialogComplete, setDescription, getDescription (and probably getMessage, getErrorMessage). This would allow (when data binding is used) the TitleAreaDialog together with TitleAreaDialogSupport to behave the same way as a WizardPage with WizardPageSupport. And this again provides a consistent GUI feel for the user.
