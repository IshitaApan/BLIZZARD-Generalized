[DataBinding] Refactor tests to be in the correct packages

The current naming schema for packages in our test project (org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding) is to include 'tests' in the name. This is an Eclipse convention[1] but the lines are somewhat grey... >"All packages containing test suites should be flagged as tests, with the tag occurring just after the major package name" This seems to only mention "suite" and not test cases. But the next sentence is what blurs the lines... >"Fully automated tests are the norm; so, for example, org.eclipse.core.tests.resources would contain automated tests for API in org.eclipse.core.resources." This says nothing about test suites but seems to reference test cases in general. The problem with following this guideline is that we can't test package level classes/methods. Since Data Binding doesn't rely upon OSGi we can't expose these classes to 'friends' with public scope so we need to make them package level. I vote that we put suites in packages with 'test' in the name but use the same name for the package as the class being tested in order to allow for greater testability.
