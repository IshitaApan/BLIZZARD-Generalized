[KeyBindings] provide general platform transform for sequence modifiers in org.eclipse.ui.bindings

It would clean up bindings even more if a platform transform was allowed in the org.eclipse.ui.bindings extension From bug 217810: The org.eclipse.ui.bindings extension point's key element will cause trouble when cocoa becomes a supported platform. We already have a lot of redundancy in our contributions for redefinitions from M2+M3+* to COMMAND+ALT+* for platform="carbon". If we have to do the same also for platform="cocoa", the plugin.xml becomes really unmanageable. c) add something like a sequenceModifier element to the bindings extension point to support transformations like this on a broader level, e.g. (syntax would have to be polished!): <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.bindings"> <sequenceModifier find="M2+M3" replace="COMMAND+ALT" platforms="carbon,cocoa" /> --------- If you could also implement something like solution c), then our plugin.xmls would become even more readable, since most of the exceptions we currently have are replacing M2+M3+* with COMMAND+ALT+* on the Mac.
