[WorkingSets] views that make use of working sets should use the window set by default

Currently the user has to touch every view they want to use the window working set in. It'd be nice if this happened for free in the SDK - all views could use the window set by default. The problem with this is that non-SDK views will be out of synch with this behaviour. They would require code changes to have consistency with our views. As a result, the SDK should only use this behaviour if it is reasonable to do so. This could be accomplished via preference or other trickery.
