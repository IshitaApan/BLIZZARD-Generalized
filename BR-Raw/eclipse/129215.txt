performance tests that run too fast (< 100 ms)

The test org.eclipse.ui.tests.performance.EditorSwitchTest#testEditorSwitch:perf_basic,perf_outline() is running in less than 100 ms on most of the test machines. That's too fast. Need to increase the length of time for which this test runs. We may want to call BasicPerformanceTest.exercise(Runnable, int, int, int) instead of BasicPerformanceTest.exercise(Runnable) from the EditorSwitchTest instead.
