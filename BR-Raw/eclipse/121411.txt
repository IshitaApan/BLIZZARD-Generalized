[HeapStatus] Heap status tooltip doesn't show mark at first

3.2M4 I brought up Eclipse and I see the HeapStatus control in the trim. Right click on it, select Set Mark. The HeapStatus control shows the black line for the mark right away, but if you hover mouse over HeapStatus the tooltip will say "... mark: <none>". It continues to show <none> for some time (maybe a minute or two) but later when I checked back and it had the right mark value in the tooltip.
