Drag start fails on Linux and Mac

The basic issues was that we were using 'hand rolled' display filters to start the drag. On Linux this failed because the eventing is asynchronous but the 'DnDInfo' was always set using the Display methods (i.e. getCursorControl(), getCursorLocation()...). By the time the mouse down event arrived the cursor had already been moved to a location where the element under (likely a part) was not a valid 'draggable' element... Selineo fixed me up with the correct pattern which is to use the 'dragDetect' event instead.
