[GlobalActions] SaveAction throws NPE for saveable views in RCP applications

Created attachment 225419 A modified Mail RCP application with a saveable view showing the problem When a view in an RCP application implements ISaveablePart and it is the default active part, SaveAction throws a NPE because the activePart is not set in the action; selecting another view and then go back to the original saveable view makes SaveAction behave correctly. I don't know why the activePart is not set at the beginning in SaveAction, but the critical part is the following public void run() { ... ISaveablePart saveView = getSaveableView(); if (saveView != null) { 		((WorkbenchPage) getActivePart().getSite().getPage()).saveSaveable(saveView, false, 					false); return; } since getActivePart() returns null; actually that is used only to retrieve the activePage which is indeed correctly set in the SaveAction (i.e., getActivePage() could be used); thus I was wondering why it does not directly call getActivePage... in attachment you find a modified Mail RCP, with the additional SaveAction, where the NavigationView is saveable: it is dirty by default so that you can immediately test the problem: just press save and get the NPE; select another view (e.g., "messages") and then go back to the navigation view and save behaves correctly.
