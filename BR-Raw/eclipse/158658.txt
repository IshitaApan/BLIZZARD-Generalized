Eclipse 3.3 presentation: Minimize too slow on Windows

3.3M2, 3.3 presentation enabled The animation is cute but it's currently too slow to be useful on my machine (WinXP SP2, dual 3.2Ghz, 2G memory, Nvidia GeForce 6200, 3 monitors). There's a noticeable pause (2-3 sec?) when it captures the screen before it starts scaling it down. javaw.exe (jdk1.5.0_06) takes close to 50% of the CPU during this period, i.e., close to 100% of a single CPU.
