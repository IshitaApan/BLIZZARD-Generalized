[Linked Resources] Copy/move of linked resource should always be shallow

build 20030129 We currently prompt whether linked resources should be deep copied/moved or shallow copied/moved. This should be changed to always do a shallow copy. Mail from John on this issues: "Chris, Jeem, and I discussed the copy issue (again!), and the consensus is that we don't allow deep copy or move at all from the UI. Copy and move of linked resources will always be shallow. Again, this is consistent with the behaviour of shortcuts and symbolic links (ever seen a prompt to deep copy a shortcut?), and with our shallow deletion behaviour." [...] "Platform UI copy/move operations will always be SHALLOW. Copy and move will be disabled for cases where the target is not a project. This is consistent UI behaviour that is in line with user expectations."
