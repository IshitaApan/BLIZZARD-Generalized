[Compatibility] Second open of File menu shifts contributions around

The first time we open the File menu, the Restart item is by Switch Workspace. The second time it opens, Restart appears at the top. The cleanup was calling removeGui(*) on the child elements. Then the Restart item was added and rendered by the listener at idx==0. Then the later call to createGui(*) on all children skip Restart because it already has a widget. PW
