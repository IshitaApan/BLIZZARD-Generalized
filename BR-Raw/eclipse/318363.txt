[UI] Closing Perspectives changes others

If you open the Debug perspective and then close it the Package Explorer disappears. Root cause was that I opened the second perspective using the perspective switcher which performed the operation 'locally' rather than going through the WorkbenchPage#setPerspective code. This meant that the 'openPerspectives' list wasn't updated which meant that the 'closePerspective' call delegated to 'closeAllPerspectives' since it thought there was only one open.
