[WorkbenchLauncher] [Preferences] Workspace path with comma

If a workspace is opened which has a comma in the path (eg "C:\docs\clients\surname, firstname"), when eclipse is closed then re-opened, the workspace does not open correctly. It instead creates a new folder of "C:\docs\clients\surname" and creates a new workspace there. Noticed that recent workspaces are kept in eclipse\configuration\.settings\org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs and that the list is comma separated. Reccommend either making the delimiter a character not usable in filenames/paths (eg. pipe character '|') or enclosing paths in quote marks.
