[Dialogs] API - make ElementTreeSelectionDialog usable with a FilteredTree

Build ID: I20070323-1616 Steps To Reproduce: I'd like to use an ElementTreeSelectionDialog with a FilteredTree. This doesn't seem to be feasible currently, because ElementTreeSelectionDialog doesn't provide a hook for the TreeViewer creation. Overriding createTreeViewer() doesn't work, because the own FilteredTree's TreeViewer can not be "registered" with ElementTreeSelectionDialog (see the fViewer variable). It would be nice if the TreeViewer creation could be decoupled from the initialization stuff, and if the fViewer assignment would not happen *in* the creation-method, but done by its caller. BTW, apparently I'm not the only one with that idea, see FilteredElementTreeSelectionDialog in the Spring IDE: http://www.koders.com/java/fid33E3AFD84053700C70BA5B69FA539D55E83562F6.aspx
