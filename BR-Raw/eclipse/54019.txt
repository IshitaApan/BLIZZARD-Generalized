[EditorMgmt] Request for close on editor drop down

pasted email from Erich Gamma --- Here are some wishes after having used the editor drop down for a while. I understand the intent to keep it as simple as possible. One functionality I miss in the drop down is support to easily close an editor without having to activate it first. Without this support I have to: 1) open the drop down 2) select the editor 3) select the close box It woud be convenient to close an editor in the drop down directly. For example: *	support a context menu (as is done in the Favorites menu of IE) *	support the ctrl+w short cut on the selection in the editor drop down * 	provide some modifier click Much less important but it would be neat to be able to activate an editor without dismissing the drop down. For example a shift-click activates the editor. This allows me to pre-view which editor it is. --erich
