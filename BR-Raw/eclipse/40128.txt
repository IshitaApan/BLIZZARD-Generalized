Decorators sometimes take two attempts to disable

Sometimes when you turn off the CVS Decorator there will still be a few items that have their decorated values. This is because in the case of the CVS decorator the disablement of it causes a refresh of the values and the result of these values may still be cached pending an update. This is not a problem if there is another decoration about to occur but if the result is no decoration an update gets sent with a stale result. Two things need to (and have) been fixed 1) The cache should be cleared before the label update is sent 2) The cache needs to be cleared in the run and well as in the done listener in case something else runs before the done is called. This is fixed in 20030716 but I will leave this open pending confirmation after the build is done.
