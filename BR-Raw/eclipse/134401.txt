Bug in JFace Window JavaDoc

Eclipse: 3.2 M5 Class: org.eclipse.jface.window.Window In text below "getContents()" should be used instead of "getControl()". 	/** 	 * Creates and returns this window's contents. Subclasses may attach any 	 * number of children to the parent. As a convenience, the return value of 	 * this method will be remembered and returned by subsequent calls to 	 * getControl(). Subclasses may modify the parent's layout if they overload 	 * getLayout() to return null. 	 * 	 * <p> 	 * It is common practise to create and return a single composite that 	 * contains the entire window contents. 	 * </p> 	 * 	 * <p> 	 * The default implementation of this framework method creates an instance 	 * of <code>Composite</code>. Subclasses may override. 	 * </p> 	 * 	 * @param parent 	 * the parent composite for the controls in this window. The type 	 * of layout used is determined by getLayout() 	 * 	 * @return the control that will be returned by subsequent calls to 	 * getControl() 	 */ 	protected Control createContents(Composite parent) { 		// by default, just create a composite 		return new Composite(parent, SWT.NONE); 	}
