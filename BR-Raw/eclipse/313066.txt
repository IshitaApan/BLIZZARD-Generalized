[Workbench] Workbench.createDisplay() needs to call Display.setAppVersion()

The first few lines of Workbench.createDisplay() are: // setup the application name used by SWT to lookup resources on some // platforms String applicationName = WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getAppName(); if (applicationName != null) { 	Display.setAppName(applicationName); } In fact, the application name - and now the application version - are also being used by screen readers. These strings are used to announce the name and version of the application, and they are used to determine any special handling that may be needed for that application and version. There is a new API on Display called setAppVersion(String). The string should be "3.6" (or "3.6.0") for Eclipse 3.6, and "3.6.1", etc. for maintenance builds. Do not use "3.6M7" or "3.6RC1". (The crash in Bug 311434 would not have happened if this had been set).
