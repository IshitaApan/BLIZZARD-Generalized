[Viewers] add a default implementation of IStructuredContentProvider

a clone of such a class can be found in so many places in eclipse that it seems resonable for jface to provide it as a default implementation (called maybe ObjectArrayContentProvider or something) everybody seems to be copying it so we might just write it once and let people use it class MyContentProvider implements IStructuredContentProvider { public Object[] getElements(Object inputElement) { return (Object[])inputElement; } public void inputChanged(Viewer viewer, Object oldInput, Object newInput) { } public void dispose() { } }
