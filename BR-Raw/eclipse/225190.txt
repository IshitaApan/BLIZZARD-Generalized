[JFace] ToolTip fails to accept mouse down event in Ganymede

If a org.eclipse.jface.window.ToolTip is created with a Hyperlink in the content, clicking the hyperlink works on Eclipse 3.2.2, but not in Ganymede Eclipse 3.3.0 build I20080207-1530 has the defect Eclipse 3.2.2 build M20080221-1800 does not have the defect I was not able to reproduce the build in Eclipse 3.2.2, however if I launched a self-hosted Eclipse 3.2.2 with org.eclipse.swt and org.eclipse.jface from HEAD, then I was able to reproduce. Note that Eclipse 3.2.2 with org.eclipse.swt from HEAD did not exhibit the bug. Steps to reproduce: 1. launch Eclipse with the attached application installed 2. Open the test view via 'Show View->Other->Test ToolTip Mouse Click Fails' 3. In the test view, hover over the tree and wait for the tooltip to display 4. target the mouse over the hyperlink in the tooltip and click the mouse 5. observe that when running on Eclipse 3.2.2 a dialog pops up indicating that the hyperlink worked, but on Eclipse 3.3.0 the dialog does not pop up indicating that the hyperlink did not receive the expected mouse events.
