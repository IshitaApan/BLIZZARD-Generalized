Eclipse hangs when deleting a "dirty" product file from a project

1. Start a new instance of Eclipse (you won't be able to exit cleanly from this scenario so don't have any unsaved work) 2. In a plugin project, add a new *.product file (File->New->Other->Plugin Dev->Product Configuration) 3. In the wizard, name the file foo.product, and select to create a file with basic settings (first radio button). Finish. 4. In the editor, type something in the "Product Name" box, just to make the file dirty. 5. Without saving, select the file in the package explorer, then press "Delete" (or right-click->Delete) 6. Eclipse politely asks "Are you sure you want to delete...?". Of course you are, so click "Yes". 7. It does something, then asks: '...' has been modified. Save changes? No, we don't want to save changes. Click "No". Result: Eclipse is hanging so badly it has to be shot down using an Anti Eclipse Missile (AEM, aka kill -9). Actually, while writing this report I noticed the hang occurs even before you answer the last dialog.
