[GlobalActions] Copy is not enabled for resources with alternate file systems

Build ID: I20071213-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create project whose file system is a plugin or zip file for example. 2. The copy menu item will not be enabled on the project, and it should be. More information: This is caused by the fact that the CopyAction checks resource.getLocation() when it should be checking for resource.getLocationURI(). Patch will be provided shortly. Note that this will only work if the patch provided for bug 164695 is also applied.
