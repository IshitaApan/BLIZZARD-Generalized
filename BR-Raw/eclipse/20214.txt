F3: Rename operation broken on AIX

Create a simple project, create a simple file, and then attempt to rename it. Eclipse *always* prompts that the new filename already exists, and asks whether you want to overwrite it. This happens in the case of a filename that does not already exist. When you choose to overwrite the nonexistent resource, an error dialog tells you that there were problems attempting to rename. Details reveal that the original filename does not exist. !?! From this point, Eclipse either removes the file entirely or has the text "ERROR" in the editor when you attempt to open the file. I could not reproduce this behavior with F3 on Linux.
