Incorrect view menu being shown when switching between views in a folder

Our application uses a number of views shown in a folder. In Eclipse 4.2.1, 4.2.2 (20130109-1200), and 4.3 (20130101-0800) we are finding that the incorrect view menu is being shown when we switch between views. The view menu is shown for the previously selected view. I can recreate this, I *think*, using the basic Eclipse SDK. Create a java project with a class and a main method. Put a breakpoint in and run. Go to the debug perspective as recommended. Now switch between the Variables and Breakpoints views and check the view menus - seems the Variables view menu is always shown. With a breakpoint in StackRenderer.showMenu, and a look up the stack trace, it appears that we're receiving an SWT.SELECTION event, but the item recorded as selected is the *previous* view. The seems incorrect.
