[DND] Drag&drop of editors

1) switch to use the editor drop down 2) double click on the left or right of the label to maximize -> works 3) try to drag the editor on the left or right -> not support you can only drag from the label. This is not consistent. Now that the title is no longer a tab I should be able to drag an editor from all over the titlebar.
