[Progress] Need way to listen to when DeferredTreeContentManager is finished

In PDE, we are trying to initialize the Plug-ins view using DeferredTreeContentManager. I am currently running into a few problems. The first is that since we have a count and I don't know when the content manager has removed the place holder, I have to hack up some code to analyze the last element in the tree to see if it is the place holder. If I could some how listen to the place holder's removal, I could them update the count when this even occurs. The second is that for a long list, the removal of the placeholder sets the visibility of the list to the bottom. In a perfect world, I would love to see a call to reset the scrollbar to the top like it would normally be initialized. But, if I could listen to the removal of the place holder, I could manually reset the scrollbar. I have thought of different ways to solve this problem. One way would be to allow users to add a job change listener which would be added to both jobs. The less invasive way would be to create a protected function called "getClearPlaceHolderJob(PendingUpdateAdapter)" or something like that. This would allow me to extend the DeferredTreeContentManager class and add my own IJobChangeListener to the removal job when it is created. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.
