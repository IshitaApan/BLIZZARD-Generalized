[Contributions] Need to remove refs to Platform.getDebugOption from JFace

build I20040323 Standalone JFace applications are currently broken due to several refs to Platform.getDebugOption in JFace, which is only available if Eclipse is running. Should have static flags for the various debug options in JFace, and initialize them from the Workbench.
