[EAS] need service for reporting errors and warnings to the user (in a dialog, or through logging)

Rationale: Having them separated is quite risky, because it introduces artificial division, in which errors are handled. Probably UI plug-ins will use IStatusHandler and Logger, while core plug-ins will just log. How can we notify the user that something went completely wrong in headless plug-in? We need to create a bridge, so actually merge those two frameworks. On the other hand, why should we pass the same problem to IStatusHandler & to Logger? Are there any Statuses which should be shown to the user (and interrupt his work) but should not be logged?
