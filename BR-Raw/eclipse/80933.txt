Property page not shown in tree

20041214 In build 20041214 create a Java project and open the properties on it. The page 'Formatter' is missing under the node 'Java Code Style' I debugged this and found that the page is correctly found in the plugin registry as one of the first pages. It is added to its category in PropertyPageManager.addToDeep(String category, PropertyPageNode node) line: 43 but the problem is that the category page is not yet read and not found. - I guess the 'Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(sortedResult), comparer)' in PropertyPageContributorManager.contribute(PropertyPageManager, IAdaptable) is the problem. Our property pages are correctly ordered so that categories are first. Also note that in general alphabetical order is not the most optimal, we would e.g. like to have a 'Advanced' page as last page under our subnode. It would be better if the order as defined by use in the plugin.xml would be taken - What should also be fixed is that pages where the category cannot be found are not simply dropped, but at least added under the root node
