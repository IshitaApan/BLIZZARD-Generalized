[WorkingSets] Navigator VS Package Explorer: working set menu items are inconsistent

I am using 3.0RC2 on Mac and on Windows. The list of working sets in the Navigator view does not provide an icon for its label, while the Package Explorer's list does. Is that intentional? The menus for both views are consistent except for the working set's label provider.
