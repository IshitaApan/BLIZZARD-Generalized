[DataBinding] TextObservableValue should take a delay-argument

Sometimes SWT.Modify is needed as update event type but the performance (number of propagated update-events) should be similar to SWT.FocusOut. Therefore I suggest to create an additional constructor with a parameter int delayInMilliseconds which defines a delay between the time the last SWT.Modify-Event occured and fireValueChanging() is called. This will allow the customer to enter multiple characters without starting a validation each time. A further advance is when binding the validation result to a label or similar, the label won't change confusingly while you still enter your text. The current structure of TextObservableValue doesn't provide a way to achieve the described behaviour by subclassing without reimplementation. Maybe this behaviour can even be useful whit SWT.FocusOut ? More information:
