[ViewMgmt] API for promoting views on a stack

In Debugland, we'd like to present the user with relevant views when they switch between debugged languages (represented as contexts). In our current implementation, I end up with a handful of view IDs that are considered applicable for the currently selected stack frame in the Debug view. The goal is to make as many of the views in this collection visible as possible. The problem I'm having is that I haven't found any API related to how views are currently stacked (tabbed). For example, say I have views A, B, and C stacked on top of each other. Views A and B are both be in the collection of "applicable views," so we'd like to make sure one of them is visible. Also, we want to make sure that if either of these views is currently visible, that view will be the one that's chosen so it will stay on top. An API to programatically determine that views A and B are stacked would solve our problem.
