[Contexts] Window context stays active when find/replace dialog open

N20060206-0010 1. open a Java editor 2. open Find/Replace (Ctrl+F) 3. press Ctrl+D (delete line) or any other editor command (e.g. Cut) ==> gets directly executed on the editor even though the Find/Replace dialog is active. Same problem when using Ctrl+O and then Ctrl+F. There's no "weird" code involved in the Find/Replace dialog. This scenario is only broken if Ctrl+O or Ctrl+T has been used at least once before. I found a scenario, where Ctrl+O isn't even involved: 1. open a Java editor 2. open Find/Replace (Ctrl+F) 3. if "Regular expressions" is checked then uncheck it, close the editor and go to 1. 4. press Ctrl+Space (code assist) ==> gets directly executed on the editor even though the Find/Replace dialog is active.
