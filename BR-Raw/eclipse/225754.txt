[Import/Export] Project name should not be same as the folder name

The problem has been detected when I import Eclipse 3.3.2 projects into Eclipse 3.4M6. My projects are organized like this: myproject/common/util myproject/common/test myproject/classworking/asm myproject/classworking/reflect ... the corresponding names of these projects are: myproject-common-util myproject-common-test myproject-classworking-asm myproject-classworking-reflect ... But in 3.4M6, when I import those projects, it appears as: util test asm reflect ... this prevents me from import projects with same dirname (but in other sub-directories)
