Some ActionSets for CDT cannot be turned off when starting enabled

CDT uses action sets to show/hide certain button/menus. The buttons/menus no longer disappear when I turn off some of the action sets. If I launch eclipse with the action set enabled, then turning it off does not have any impact. If I launch eclipse with the action set disabled, then turning it on then off behaves correctly. I am first seeing this bug in the M4 build; M3 behaves as expected. I wasn't able to reproduce this with some other action set that I found in platform or in CDT. To try this out: 1- install CDT :) 2- Enable action set "Reverse Debugging". You will see a new button appear in the main tool bar with a little clock and a double arrow. 3- Close eclipse 4- Start eclipse (now the action set is pre-enabled) 5- disable the "Reverse Debugging" action set => the button will not disappear. Details and screenshot about this action set can be quickly seen at: http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#How_do_I_do_Reverse_Debugging.3F You can also reproduce this with the "C/C++ Tracepoints" action set: http://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/FAQ#How_can_I_trace_my_application_using_C.2FC.2B.2B_Tracepoints.3F Please let me know if I can help figuring this out. Thanks
