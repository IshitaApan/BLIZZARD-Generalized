[CoolBar] Coolbars missing on startup

build I20040318-1131 - started up eclipse - all coolbars are missing, except for the File one, but including the hard-wired Navigation one - nothing in the log - less of interest in the console than usual: I'm running with org.eclipse.jface/trace/toolbarDisposal=true and normally see complaints about dups for the hardwired items, but did not see these this time
