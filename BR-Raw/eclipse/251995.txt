[LinkedResources] Error logged when opening Properties dlg on a Linked Resource folder involving a path variable

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #198091 +++ Eclipse 3.3 on WinXP / Sun 1.6.0_01 Steps To Reproduce: 1.In physical file system, create C:\foo\bar\baz 2.Define a Path Variable: Window > Preferences > General > Workspace > Linked Resources Add: "WIND_HOME" -> C:\foo 3.Create a new simple project in empty workspace: File > New > Project, (General:Project), name=fooproj 4. Create a linked resource folder in the new project File > New > Folder, Advanced:Link, Variables:select WIND_HOME, Extend -> drill down till you get the Link WIND_HOME/bar Project Explorer expands contents below the linked resource properly. Right-click on the linked resource folder bar > Properties --> Error log shows two entries: "Must specify a URI scheme:WIND_HOME/bar" (org.eclipse.core.filesystem) "Must specify a URI scheme:WIND_HOME/bar" (org.eclipse.ui.ide) More information: In spite of the errors logged, everything else seems to work as expected, so I'm marking this issue as minor. We have seen the very same issue before and logged it as bug 180363 comment 1 which was originally about creating linked resources with variables. After fixing that issue, links can now be created with variables but the error still occurs when looking at properties of the resource. The same errors are logged in Eclipse 3.2.1, but we do not see them in Eclipse 3.1.2 so we think it's a regression introduced by EFS. Bug 182722 also seems similar, but this one is easier to reproduce and has fewer dependencies (no JDT involved). Bug 151965 is similar for deleted resources while here the resource exists. The contents of the .project file looks like this: <linkedResources> 	<link> 		<name>bar</name> 		<type>2</type> 		<locationURI>WIND_HOME/bar</locationURI> 	</link> </linkedResources>
