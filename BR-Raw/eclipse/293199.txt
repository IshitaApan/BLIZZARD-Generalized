[FieldAssist] Content assist popup appears in the wrong location (bounds are incorrect)

When content assist is attached to a Text widget, the location of the suggestion popup is incorrect. Content assist is applied as follows: bc. TextContentAdapter textContentAdapter = new TextContentAdapter(); IContentProposalProvider provider = // provider ContentAssistCommandAdapter adapter = new ContentAssistCommandAdapter(nameText, textContentAdapter, 						provider, org.eclipse.ui.fieldassist.ContentAssistCommandAdapter.CONTENT_PROPOSAL_COMMAND, new char[0],true); adapter.setProposalAcceptanceStyle(ContentAssistCommandAdapter.PROPOSAL_REPLACE); I'm not sure if it matters, the Text is embedded in an expandable section in a SashForm in a multipage editor. attaching two screenshots showing popup placement issue.
