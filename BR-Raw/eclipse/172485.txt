o.e.u.ide  action sets need to be converted to commands and moved to ide.application

I20070130-0800. When trying out the new org.eclipse.ui.ide which got freed from application code that got moved into org.eclipse.ui.ide.application (see bug 167893) in an RCP app, I found out that the separation is not yet complete: the o.e.u.ide/plugin.xml expects that the application has created a 'Window' and a 'Help' menu and if they aren't built by the workbench window advisor clients get: !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.688 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): selectWorkingSets !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.688 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): removeFromWorkingSet !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.698 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): addToWorkingSet !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.708 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): org.eclipse.update.ui.updateMenu !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.708 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): org.eclipse.update.ui.configManager !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.718 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): org.eclipse.update.ui.newUpdates !ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-01 14:12:07.718 !MESSAGE Invalid Menu Extension (Path is invalid): org.eclipse.ui.actions.showKeyAssistHandler Besides the above mentioned menus ui.ide also expects the 'Edit'and 'Navigate' menus but that doesn't harm because the corresponding action sets are set to not be visible per default. We either need to move those contributions to ui.ide.application or set the visibility of the affected action sets to 'false' and enable them in ui.ide.application.
