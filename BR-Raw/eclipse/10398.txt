SWT error causes Workbench meltdown

A few minutes ago I discovered the new dialog for reporting internal errors related to SWT. It said something like: "An SWT error has occurred. You should exit the workbench now. Further errors could cause the workbench to close without notice." This is more or less what happened: Curious, I clicked on Details. No additional details pane appeared. So I clicked again. Then the workbench closed without notice, but the dialog remained. So I stupidly clicked Details again. The "saving workbench state" progress monitor appeared again and went away. So I clicked ok. And it tried to save the workbench state again, and popped up a new SWT error dialog. I think I clicked away (with Ok) one or two more of the things. After this point, Eclipse hangs on startup after closing the splash screen. To recover, I tried the following: - delete the .lock file and try again - delete the .registry file and try again - delete everything under .metadata/plugins except org.eclipse.core.resources This worked. I would attach an archive of my workspace, but I did not think about it at the time. Sorry!
