[KeyBindings] request: Back/Forward keys and mouse buttons don't work with Eclipse

Back and Forward keys on MS Internet keyboard don't trigger Backward History and Forward History commands even though Alt-Left and Alt-Right key sequences do trigger them. There is no way to map a command to Back or Forward keyboard keys or to extra buttons of a 5-button mouse.
