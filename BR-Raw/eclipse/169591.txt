[Common Navigator] Show In fails for editor inputs

The show(ShowInContext) method for CommonNavigator only considers the selection of the context. When Show In Project Explorer is performed from an editor, the selection is empty and the input is provided. Unfortunately, this is problematic, as the show-in target needs to adapt the input to an IFile so this will probably need to have some sort of extension so that the Project Explorer can plug-in the proper support.
