[Workbench] The default browser handler(DefaultWebBrowser) in ui.workbench doesn't work on SLED10

Build ID: Eclipse 3.2/3.3M4 Env: Linux/SLED 10 Eclipse: 3.2.2 or 3.3M4 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Start Eclipse, setup a run to Run a product with "org.eclipse.sdk.ide". 2. In the "Run" setting, select "Plug-ins" tab, unselect "org.eclipse.ui.browser". 3. Run the application. 4. In the new IDE window, select "Help->About Eclipse SDK->Feature Details to show feature details dialog. 5. Select one of the dialog, press "License" key. Problem: An error dialog is shown "Unable to open web browser on {0}" with "OK" button. Expected: Shown the license file with an external browser, e.g, firefox. More information: - Our application doesn't ship with "org.eclipse.ui.browser", so the default handler(DefaultWebBrowser class) in ui.workbench is handling the openURL calls. - From the DefaultWebBrowser code, it is really old to launch external browser on Linux. It only tries to start "netscape" and "mozilla". Now most of linux distributions are shipping with Firefox. - Can ui.workbench uses Program.launch() as default action?
