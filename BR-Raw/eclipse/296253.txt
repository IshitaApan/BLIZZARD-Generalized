[CommonNavigator] An empty label is not properly shown when it is the only contributed label

The change in Bug 289090 has caused a significant regression in our GMF based editor. We have GMF elements that are not yet named in the project explorer. The elements have a blank name and icon. Elements are created and subsequently the user can set a name. In some cases however, these elements are never given a name and "" always shows in the project explorer. in the newer target, we now check for a zero length string and returns null: String text= labelProvider.getText(anElement); if (text != null && text.length() > 0) { return new StyledString(text); } } return null; The getStyledText(...) method gets the null value and returns the error message that we see CommonNavigatorMessages.NavigatorContentServiceLabelProvider_Error_no_label_provider_for_0_
