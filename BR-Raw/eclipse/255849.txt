[Metadata] Wrong types and methods used in org.eclipse.ui.workbench

That bundle is supposed to be Foundation 1.0 compliant according to the 3.4 plan. Maybe this has changed for 3.5. The EEs defined for this project are: Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: J2SE-1.4, CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0, J2SE-1.3 And for the compilation, pde.build ends up taking the first execution environment which is 1.4. If pde.build would take the latest execution environment, it would not compile. The bundle execution environment should be changed to 1.4 or some type references and method calls should be removed. Here is the list of possible problematic references found by the new validation from api tooling: - java.lang.String.replaceAll(String, String) - java.util.regex.Pattern and its methods - java.lang.StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer) - java.lang.String.split(String) - RuntimeException(Throwable) - Error(Throwable) - java.lang.Throwable.initCause(Throwable) - java.util.regex.Matcher and its methods - javax.swing.SwingUtilities - java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager - javax.swing.FocusManager - java.lang.Throwable.getStackTrace() - java.lang.StackTraceElement.toString() Let me know if any of these references is considered to be fine. Here is the complete list that let you know in what types the references were found: The method java.lang.String.replaceAll(String, String) referenced in
