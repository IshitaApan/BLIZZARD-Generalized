[Decorators] Decorators activated too soon

20021113 Decorators are created as soon as they are enabled - they should only be created first time they are applied as they not be required if thier enablement state does not pass. STEPS 1) Create a workbench with no content 2) Enable the binary project decorator - it will be created even though there is nothing to decorate.
