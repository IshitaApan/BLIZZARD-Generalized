[Contributions] legacy actions become disabled in multipage editors after being invoked

This bug is a followup to bug 185245. After that bug was fixed, I noticed that if I invoke an action in a multipage editor, the action becomes disabled until I switch focus to another part and then come back. So I am basically only able to invoke an action once and then I have to switch focus before I can use it again. I think this may have to do with part activation in multipage editors. I noticed when org.eclipse.ui.actions.ContributedAction#runWithEvent is called, 	IHandler oldHandler = getParameterizedCommand().getCommand() 					.getHandler(); oldHandler will be null for multipage editors. I also notice some funniness with org.eclipse.ui.internal.services.ActivePartSourceProvider and what it reports as the active editor. There may be a mixup of the definition of "active editor" I will try to come up with a code example soon (tomorrow)
