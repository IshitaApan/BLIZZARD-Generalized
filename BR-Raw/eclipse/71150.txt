[RCP] [Perspectives] Allow no initial perspective

I the WorkbenchAdvisor.java we need to return no perspective for our product. public String getInitialWindowPerspective(){ return null; } We have made modifications to Eclipse 3.0 WorkbenchWindow and Workbench.java to do this. This is required for our product and there is documentation why. I submit this bug to track this inclusion into Eclipse 3.0.1
