Hard coded colour making text unreadable

The popup menu to select an editor (used when there are many editor windows open) is hard coded to a background colour of white. This is fine if you use a typical text colour of black. It's very bad if you use an inverted colour display scheme, as you end up with pale text on a white background, which is effectively unreadable (especially on a laptop screen). The correct behaviour should likely be something along the lines of using the platforms default tooltip colour, or at least the default text editor background colour (note, that haven't seen any other popup menus in eclipse with this problem). The offending code would appear to be in org.eclipse.ui.internal.presentations.EditorList , in the constructor: public EditorList(Shell parent, int shellStyle, int treeStyle) { super(parent, shellStyle, treeStyle); setBackgroundColor(new Color(parent.getDisplay(), 255, 255, 255)); } <RANT>I know I don't need to remind you eclipse folks, as you've done a commendable job so far; for everyone else out there (especially web designers): if you 'must' hardcode a background colour, you __must__ hard code the forground colour as well!!!!</RANT> Thank you :)
