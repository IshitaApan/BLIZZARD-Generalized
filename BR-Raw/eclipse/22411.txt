[Editor Mgmt] Wrong tab handling in the editor

The tab handling in the editor has a few bugs. First of all, the column number showed in the right corner isn't correct when using tabs. The number is simply incremented by 4 (or the tab size you entered) indipendently how much whitespace is inserted. You can reproduce this by viewing the file tabtest.txt in the Eclipse editor. The column number of the first tab should always be 5, and the second 9. The second point is that the representation of the tabs doesn't depend by the font metrics. Take a look at the file enumeration.java The font size is set to 12 pt and the keywords are shown bold. All the equal signs should be in the same column (an they are, at least in an other editor). But they aren't. Only if you turn off the bold representation of the keywords, the text is shown correctly. Also, the position of the equal signs depends by the font size.
