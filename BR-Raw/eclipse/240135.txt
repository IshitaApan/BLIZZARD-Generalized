[ErrorHandling] ErrorDialog#createDialogArea does not respect  Dialog#createDialogArea contract

Created attachment 106930 An example Build ID: I20080617-2000 Dialog#createDialogArea javadoc says: * @return the dialog area control but ErrorDialog#createDialogArea overrides Dialog#createDialogArea, does not call super (what is acceptable) and creates some components that are out of the dialog area control. The problem appears when someone extends ErrorDialog and places additional widgets (createMessageArea overriden) *and* support area is enabled. Support Area increases the number of available columns in GridLayout, however it is created after message area. So increasing columns count causes all widget to be shifted. ChangeExceptionHandler#RefactorErrorDialog is a good example (see attachment 1).
