[CommonNavigator] Confusing javadocs in CommonNavigator

Build ID: I20090528-2000 This is trivial and subjective, but it tripped me up so I thought I would report it. CommonNavigator javadocs says "Clients are not expected to subclass CommonNavigator". But later the docs somewhat contradict this with "This class may be instantiated or subclassed". It's clear the class is designed for extension so it would be helpful to clarify that first sentence, and as a bonus describe some expected use cases for subclassing. For example, this tutorial gives a good one http://www.techjava.de/topics/2009/04/eclipse-common-navigator-framework/ "CommonNavigator gets its initial input (during initialization) from the Workbench by calling getSite().getPage().getInput(). In the IDE scenario, the default page input is IWorkspaceRoot, in the RCP scenario it is null and can be configured in the WorkbenchAdvisor. Instead, another implementation of getInitialInput() can be provided, passing the dummy Root object, which indicates the root of the tree."
