[Perspectives] Reference to invalid views are not removed

When a non-displayed perspective contains a invalid view (the corresponding plugin has been removed, ...), a "Unable to restore perspective" error message is displayed after each launch of eclipse, until the perspective is display one time. 1. Open eclipse, open a view which belong to a plugin you can easily add and remove (I used the EditorList plugin). 2. Open an other perspective (the 'Java' perspective for example). You have now two opened perspective. The 'java' perspective is displayed. 3. Close eclipse. 4. Remove/Move the plugin 5. Restart eclipse. A "Unable to restore perspective ..." error message is displayed, which is fine, we just remove the plugin. 6. Close and restart eclipse. The same "Unable to restore perspective ..." error message is displayed. Why do we still get this error message ? The plugin was not available the last time eclipse was closed, so the workbench should have no more reference on this plugin. 7. Switch to the perspective which contains the view which no longer exists. Same "Unable to restore perspective ..." error message. Why the workbench try to create this view an other time ? It already tried, and it can't. 8. Close and restart eclipse. No more error messages.
