System can be shut down without save-file warnings

When a WSWB session is open with some opened, dirty .txt file, shutting down Windows will cause the loss of the changes in the .txt file. Steps To Reproduce: start WSWB and create a new project create a text file in the project and add a line of text to it. Notice that the text file is marked as a dirty file Left click on the Windows Start menu, select “Shut Down…” command to shut down/reboot the computer Results: There is no warning or question message box to give users a chance to save their dirty model(s), the computer is shut down/rebooted immediately. Other Windows programs (like Word, Outlook etc. provide a “Do you want to save your file”, Yes, No, Cancel (which halts the shutdown) dialog box. Expected Behaviour: Should provide a “Do you want to save your file”, Yes, No, Cancel (which halts the shutdown) dialog box. One other nice feature might be to allow the applications to control the shutdown/save also or to pop up there own windows that would also (if cancel is selected) allow the user to stop the shutdown.
