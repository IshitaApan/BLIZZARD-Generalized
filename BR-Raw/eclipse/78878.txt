[Preferences] Navigation history for workbench preference page

As discussed, I will attach a a patch against WorkbenchPreferenceDialog that implements a navigation history. Notes: 1) Placement I placed the controls at the bottom between the import/export and ok/cancel buttons. This is probably not final, but I figured as long as you are changing around the layout anyway, this might be a good place to start. Placing the control somewhere else is easy, simply call createHistoryControls from whereever you like. 2) Persistence The history does not persist over closing and reopening the preference dialog. This may be a later option we could discuss, but it seems reasonable to me as it is now (a browser doesn't store the forward/backward contents over sessions either). 3) The history domain elements are currently preference page ids. This may change once we have a more finegrained addressing scheme as discussed.
