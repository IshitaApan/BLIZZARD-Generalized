[CellEditors] Mixing up between undo and redo in CellEditorActionHandler

The undo(redo) action's enabled state gets wrong with CellEditorActionHandler. Please see the following code in org.eclipse.ui.part.CellEditorActionHandler at version 1.12 (latest at this point), > private IPropertyChangeListener undoActionListener = new ActionEnabledChangeListener( > cellRedoAction); ~~~~ > private IPropertyChangeListener redoActionListener = new ActionEnabledChangeListener( > cellUndoAction); ~~~~ As the code above, undo and redo are mixed up, and the enabled state's change of undo(redo) action updates redo(undo) action.
