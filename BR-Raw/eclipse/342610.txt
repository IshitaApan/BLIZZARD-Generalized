[Forms] Form heading wraps text unexpectedly

Build Identifier: 20100218-1602 The form heading unexpectedly wraps heading text. A code snippet will be attached that defines a basic editor with a short form heading text string. When the editor is first displayed, there is a generous amount of horizontal space, more than sufficient to display the entire string, however, the last word form heading text appears to be truncated. If the editor is resized horizontally (shrunk), the last word of the form heading text will appear on the second line of the header. Incidentally, some longer heading text strings do not exhibit this problem. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Display the editor defined by the attached code snippet. The last word form heading text appears to be truncated. When the editor is resized horizontally (shrunk), the last word of the form heading text will appear on the second line of the header.
