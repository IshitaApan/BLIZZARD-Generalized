Lack of a product welcome.xml specification breaks Welcome...

F3 If the primary feature does not include a welcome.xml in the about.ini - no other welcome.xml files can be opened. The Help>Welcome... results in nothing (the list selection dialog of available welcome.xml files is not opened). WSWB was planning on not providing a welcome as it was redundant with the platform (we had been copying that file forward). Are we trapped or can we fix Welcome... to work even when the primary feature does not have a welcome.xml specified.
