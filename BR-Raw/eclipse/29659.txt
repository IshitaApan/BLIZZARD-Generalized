[Linked Resources] New Folder and New File dialogs

1. The New Folder and New File dialogs have no mnemonic for the Advanced button, and its seems that the 'Link to..' mnemonic 'L' can not be invoked (tried pressing Alt-L). 2. Attempting to create a link to a folder already linked (overlapping) gives a very long warning message in the white title area of the dialog - so long that it can not be read in its entirety.
