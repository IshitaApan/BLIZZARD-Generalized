adaptable flag on property pages doesn't work if filtered by nature

(Apologies if this is a dup, I couldn't find such a bug anywhere). org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui defines the following property page: <page name="%CVS" id="org.eclipse.team.ccvs.ui.propertyPages.CVSPropertiesPage" 	objectClass="org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject" 	class="org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSPropertiesPage" adaptable="true"> 	<filter name="nature" value="org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature"/> </page> In the packages view, this does not work because I believe the filter is being tested BEFORE the adaptation takes place. The IJavaProject does not have the "nature" value set, but the IProject that it adapts to DOES, so the filter should be tested after adaptation rather than before. The result is that non-CVS projects have a CVS properties page in the packages view, and likewise non-CVS compilation units (not IFiles, they work fine) also have a CVS properties page due to a similar declaration in the plugin.xml.
