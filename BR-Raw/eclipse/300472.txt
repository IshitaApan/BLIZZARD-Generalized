[Dialogs] [JFace] Provide accessor for dialog messages

It would be nice to have access to the Dialog messages (eg. IDialogConstants.OK_LABEL) trough API instead of a field access. This would allow the RAP team to provide a session-based translation for the labels and furthermore improves the usability for our current users. Developers who want to single-source their applications for RCP and RAP cannot use the existing API of JFace as the labels are hardcoded as static fields and RAP has no chance to intervene this behavior without breaking API. I suggest to provide an accessor like SWT.getMessage() to get the translated string as this would allow developers to use the same API in RCP and JFace. I'd be happy to provide a patch once we decided on a possible approach. As suggested above, I'd introduce an accessor on Dialog itself and introduce message keys in IDialogConstants.
