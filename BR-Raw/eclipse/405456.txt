Allow tests to disable auto-save job

From Bug 405356 comment #12 +100 for not having a feature in default eclipse that forces long wait on jobs finishing. I believe we are not the only one that has test that wait for the jobs to finish to avoid conflicts. We also disable certain jobs explicitly to avoid this (i.e. build and validations are often cause of issues when running tests because they are not build for speed/unitests) Using plugin_customization.ini is really not a sustainable way to disable this - we would have to put a plugn_customization.ini into every test plugin - configured it in Tycho AND in eclipse (even worse) to be used. Could we please get a system property or other way of ensuring this job is not going to be present since it is *not* something that makes sense to have during test runs.
