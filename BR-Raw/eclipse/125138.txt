[LinkedResources] cannot extend variable

Using I20060118-0800 Using the contextual menu upon a project that has at least one linked source folder: - Build Path/Configure Build Path; - Source tab; - select a linked source folder, Edit; - Variables; - define CURRENT_WORKSPACE pointing to the current workspace root: - New; - Name: CURRENT_WORKSPACE; - Folder...: select the workspace root, then OK; - OK; - Extend: gets a 'No entries available'. I may miss a point here, but I believe this not correct. I would expect to be able to select a subdirectory of my current workspace. Pointing the variable to a Java project root doesn't seem to help.
