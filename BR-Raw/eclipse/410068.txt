Keybinding Context switching stops working after reporting a conflict when switching to sibling context

Created attachment 232038 Example-Editor usign context service In eclipse 4.2 and still in 4.3RC3 the keybinding context switching doesn't work correctly. If switching to a sibling context, eclipse reports a conflict with the previously context even if it was deactivated before. After the conflict it seems like it even doesn't switch to back to the parent context. One interessting thing is that after this error occurs, deactivating the editor by for example clicking on the Project Explorer and activating the editor again. Allows to activate the contexts again. Attached is a simple editor example for using ALT+PAGE_UP. 1. create a .txt-file 2. open the example editor for the file 3. click on Editor.Editor1-Button and hit ALT+PAGE_UP, command Editor1 is executed 4. click on Editor.Editor1.1-Button and hit ALT+PAGE_UP, command Editor1.1 is executed 5. click on Editor.Editor2-Button, a conflict is reported 6. hit ALT+PAGE_UP, command Editor1.1 is executed 7. click on Editor.Editor1-Button and hit ALT+PAGE_UP, command Editor1.1 is still executed 8. deactivate the editor 9. activate the editor 10. click on Editor.Editor2-Button and hit hit ALT+PAGE_UP, command Editor2 is executed Note that this is working in eclipse 3.8 and all transitions between the three contexts are performed without any problem. For us this is more or less a blocker. Since we make heavy use of this feature, we have to adviced our customers to stick with 3.8 until this is fixed.
