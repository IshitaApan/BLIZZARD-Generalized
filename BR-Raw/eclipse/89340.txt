[Preferences] Preferences working copy: Pages want to submit update jobs

20040329 The preference working copies are applied after all pages have their 'performOk()' called. That's fine, but raises the problem for pages that need to do a full build after changes. Before they could do it on 'performOk()', now this doesn't do anything as changes are not yet applied to the preference store. Suggestion is that pages can post update jobs that will be ran after the working copies have been applied. Advantage of that is also that the preferences infrastructure can detect and merge Jobs doings the same (e.g. full build jobs, using a unique job-familiy). Other advantage is that when a page cancels the 'OK' (by returning 'false' on performOk()) the infrastructure would not apply the working copy settings (not implemented at the moment) and also not run the update jobs.
