[Markers] Contributions to IMarker no longer show up on elements in the Problems View

I own function in WTP that contributes an action to IMarkers. In previous versions of Eclipse this function was available on errors and warnings displayed in the Problems View by right clicking and selecting the action. The action no longer shows up and it seems that the fix for bug 65464 that I opened for this same problem in the 3.0 time frame has crept back into the Problems View. My contribution is done with the following snippet: <objectContribution objectClass="org.eclipse.core.resources.IMarker" id="org.eclipse.wst.xml.validation.internal.core.nestederrorlist" nameFilter="*"> Without delving too deep into the Problems View code it seems that I can get the functionality I want by specifying an objectClass of org.eclipse.ui.views.markers.internal.ProblemMarker. However this object class is internal. There should be a public way to provide actions on the errors and warnings displayed in the Problems View.
