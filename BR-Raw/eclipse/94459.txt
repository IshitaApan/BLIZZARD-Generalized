[Undo] - should refactoring undo work when text undo limit is 0?

Refactoring undos are not showing up in the package explorer undo menu when the text undo limit is set to 0. Technically the refactoring operation should be permitted on the workspace undo context history. The history should just be removing the text context from the operation. One could argue this is a correctly working "feature" but need to check why it's happening and resolve the behavior as a bug or document as expected outcome.
