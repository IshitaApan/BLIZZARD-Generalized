Setting clientArea disabled in WorkbenchWindow#run(..) still allows typing in Editor

From Bug 409274 As part of fixing bug 404016, we disable disableControl(tpl.clientArea, toEnable); and that should disable all typing in the views and editors. Despite the ancestor of the editor StyledText being disabled, we were still able to type into the editor. PW
