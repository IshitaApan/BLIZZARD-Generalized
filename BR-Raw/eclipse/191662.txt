[Import/Export] Warn of duplicate projects in project import wizard

Build ID: I20070601-1539 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a project. 2. Export it to *.zip file. 3. Close the project. 4. Try to import it. 5. Empty projects list. More information: This is pretty annoying, since I am using mylar and a workspace with many closed projects. If I try to import a project that already exists, I see nothing and I am pretty confused (there is no warning).
