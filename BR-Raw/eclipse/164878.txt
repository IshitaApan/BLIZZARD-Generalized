[Capabilities] Need a property tester for activities

In 3.3 user assistance will allow expressions in documents like welcome pages, help xhtml documents, table of contents, etc to allow extra flexibility when filtering. For products or component that integrate with other components, it is sometimes desirable to control the visibility/discoverability of certain content based on what else is enabled in the UI (e.g. for advertising functionality or integration points). We need a property tester to test for this. This applies to both activities (is it a java developer?) and categories (is it a developer?). A property tester for this is also required for cases where we want activity filtering within documents, not just at the document level, and we have no id or pattern to match by. Patch will be provided.
