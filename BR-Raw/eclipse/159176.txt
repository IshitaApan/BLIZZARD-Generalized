[Presentations] Editor minimize/maximize buttons visible on startup even though perspective is fixed

In a simple RCP application with one (fixed) perspective and no views (just editors), the editor area minimize/maximize buttons are made visible when workbench is first restored. Opening one or more editors and then closing them removes the buttons for the duration of the session (subsequent editor opening/closing doesn't make the buttons reappear). Even though the buttons are visible, they are not functional (as expected). It appears that when the editor presentation is first created, there is no active perspective in the workbench page and thus WorkbenchPage.isFixedLayout() returns true. This causes the min/max buttons to be made visible. Next time the editor presentation is created (i.e., after closing all initial editors), the perspective is there and WorkbenchPage.isFixedLayout() returns true. This makes the min/max buttons invisible. One workaround is to implement a custom presentation factory, extend createEdirorPresentation and decorate the provided IStackPresentationSite with an implementation that does not support the minimize/maximize states.
