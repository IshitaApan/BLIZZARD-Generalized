[Trim] Toolbar not visible with 4.3 legacy mode

I'm trying to port an RCP application from eclipse 3.8 to 4.3. Adding the necessary elements like LegacyIDE.e4xml and default css theme the application seems to work, however after the first restart the toolbar is not visible anymore. The toolbar is visible only when clearPersistedState is set to true, which is unacceptable because it resets all customized layouts. After some more attempts I found that the toolbar is perfectly visible when running with eclipse 4.2, so it seems a regression of some kind with eclipse 4.3.
