NPE after importing Editor page preferences

F3 build Sorry for the long set of steps, but I couldn't find a smaller set that caused the problem: - open Preferences dialog, go to Workbench - Editors page - check the Close Editors Automatically checkbox - press Export... at bottom of Preferences dialog, export the current preferences to a file -> preference dialog will subsequently close - open Preferences dialog, will be on Workbench - Editors page - click Restore Defaults, OK -> unchecks Close Editors Automatically checkbox and closes Preferences dialog - open Preferences dialog, will be on Workbench - Editors page - press Import... at bottom of dialog, select the previously-exported preferences file for import, Open - preferences are imported, OK - open Preferences dialog, will be on Workbench - Editors page - press Restore Defaults, OK - get the attached exception
