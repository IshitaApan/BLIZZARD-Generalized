[Presentations] (regression) Changing Tab Position from Top to Bottom doesn't work

When I change the preferred tab position for editors or views from top to bottom and restart Eclipse, nothing changes. This I'd like to do: 1. Menu: Window -> Preferences 2. General -> Appearance 3. Current Presentation: "Default (current)" 4. Activate "Override presentation settings" 5. Activate "Editor tab positions" to "Bottom" and/or "View tab positions" 6. After clicking "Apply" and/or "OK" Eclipse wants to restart. 7. After the restart the tabs are still on the top. This seems to be a bug. I'm using Eclipse 3.2M4. This feature has worked under Eclipse 3.1.
