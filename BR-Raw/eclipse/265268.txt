[About] Improving the new About Dialog

The new About dialog is much better than the previous one. I feel that it could still be improved. Here are my suggestions: (*) When the user presses Help->About, a dialog opens. Then the user has to press "Installation Details", which opens up another dialog. I'm not a big fan of 'dialog over dialog over dialog ...' situation, as its little irritating when you have to press Close/OK several times to get back to the original window. Can't we have the second dialog itself in the original dialog, something with "Details >>" button? (*) In the Plug-ins tab 'Columns' should be 'Columns...' or 'Configure Columns...'? (*) 'Show Signing Info' is better to have as a checkbox rather than a push button? (*) The order of the tabs are now thru the digits prefixed in their ids. Why can't we have an optional attribute called order in the extension point itself? (*) When the configuration tab is loading, there is no indication in the UI. It was frozen for 2/3 seconds. How about wrapping the ConfigurationInfo.getSystemSummary() inside a BusyIndicator.showWhile()?
