[Compatibility] View may be physically opened in a perspective without a placeholder

1. Wipe your deltas. 2. Select a Java file in the 'Package Explorer'. 3. Ctrl+Shift+G 4. The 'Search' view will appear 5. Hide it. 6. Window > Open Perspective > Debug 7. Ctrl+3 > Package Explorer 8. Select the same file. Though it should already be selected. 9. Ctrl+Shift+G 10. The 'Search' view will appear 11. Window > Open Perspective > Debug 12. Select the same file. Again, it should already be selected. 13. Ctrl+Shift+G 14. You will switch to the 'Debug' perspective. All other future attempts to show the view will result in either a) nothing happening or b) switching to the 'Debug' perspective. Based on analysis of the actual model, a physical MPart has been added into the 'Debug' perspective instead of an MPlaceholder.
