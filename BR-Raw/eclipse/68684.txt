[EditorMgmt] tabs: Remove the MRU tab reordering code from the default presentation

DefaultPartPresentation recently added code to arrange the editor tabs in left-to-right order until the tab list is full, in which case it inserts at the end of the visible list. There is also code to rearrange tabs when an invisible editor is selected from the dropdown. This behavior is quite complicated, which makes it hard to keep track of where editors are. It also makes it impossible for the user to arrange the tabs themselves, since Eclipse may subsequently move an editor if it is selected through the dropdown. It would be much simpler if the following changes were made: 1. The tabs always opened in left-to-right order. The window of visible tabs would scroll to show the newly opened editor if it isn't already visible. 2. The editor dropdown always showed editors in the same order that they are shown in the tabs rather than in alphabetical order (although highlighting the currently visible tabs makes sense) 3. In addition to the dropdown, left and right arrows could be shown on either end of the tabs, to indicate to the user that they are looking at a sliding window of tabs.
