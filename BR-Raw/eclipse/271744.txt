[Viewers] [JFace] TreeViewer not closing CellEditors on Collapse

Created attachment 131382 Modified Snippet to show the error Build ID: M20090211-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Run the attached (modified) snippet 2. When running, make sure to manually resize the first column so you actually see something. 3. Expand a node (eg. Item 0.2) and start editing one of its children. Notice that when you first click on the item, the entire text is highlighted. 4. Collapse the parent item and reexpand it. 5. Click the previously edited item again and notice that the text does not get selected, as the editor is still open. More information: The Cell Editor should be closed, when the cell it is sitting on is no longer visible due to a collapse. In my actual implementation the CellEditor still recieves keyboard input, thus allowing for users to mess up their data pretty bad without even noticing.
