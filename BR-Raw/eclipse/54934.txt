[Intro] The right intro to use should be defined in about.ini

In the original design of the org.eclipse.ui.intro extension point, the idea was that 'productId' attribute would be used to map the intro with the product it should be used for. We got feedback that the link feels up-side-down i.e. the product should define the id of the intro to use. This makes sense because today we define welcome to use in about.ini of the primary feature's plug-in. We should do the same thing for the new intro: 1) Define a new property (not the old 'welcome' to retain backaward compatibility) that defines the intro ID to use with the primary feature. 2) During the startup sequence, fetch the IProduct object, and get the intro ID from it as a property. Then locate the org.eclipse.ui.intro extension whose 'intro' element has the matching ID, instantiate it and show it. Set severity to 'major' to try to get this in by M8 (keep dreaming :-).
