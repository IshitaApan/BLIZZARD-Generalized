[KeyBindings] error messages fill up my log

Build: I-20050301-1230 So I launch Eclipse on an existing workspace and the log fills up with entries that look like: Error 2005-03-01 16:57:57.860 Defining a key binding with no key sequence has no effect: 'org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui', 'org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.commands.AddExcep tionBreakpoint'. I get double the fun when I launch a runtime workbench as these error messages appear in the log and the console. Should I be alarmed?
