[Fonts/Colors]  Consistant use of API

200403230010 The new work to support toolbars in the tab folder requires the use of horizontal gradients, which is fine. However, they are currently being hardcoded. This should be specified by changing the "org.eclipse.ui.workbench.INACTIVE_TAB_VERTICAL" data element in the themes extension in org.eclipse.ui/plugin.xml. Also, we're doing this work in several different places. The work in ColorSchemeService directly competes with the code that draws the hardcoded gradient. We should stick with a consistant pattern for setting these properties. If ever we no longer need a property (perhaps "org.eclipse.ui.workbench.INACTIVE_TAB_VERTICAL" really does need to be hardcoded all the time) then the code that relies on them should be cleaned up and the property removed.
