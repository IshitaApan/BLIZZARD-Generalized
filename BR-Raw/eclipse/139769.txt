[Progress] Builds show X instead of red square to cancel

RC2 Any reschedulable job (like the auto build) is showing up in the progress view as completed as it has the result from the previous build still. The condition to check if the job is completed should be 	if (infos[i].getJob().getState() != Job.NONE) not 	if (infos[i].getJob().getResult() == null)
