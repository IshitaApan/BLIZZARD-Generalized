[Navigator] Copying out-of-sync resource over existing deletes existing and aborts copy

From bug 20646: "I selected several files to be copied from one folder to another. The target folder already had files of the same name. When I pasted the files into the target folder, I was prompted to overwrite an existing file. [...] ...some of the resources I was coping were out-of-sync with the local file system so the operation failed and all the conflicting files in the target folder were deleted but no resources were copied." Should not delete files in the target folder unless they will actually be replaced by the source.
