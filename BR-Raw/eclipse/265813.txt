[StatusHandling]Reduce the incompatibility between status dialog and  jface ErrorDialog

It is possible to automatically open support area when an error issues (bug 249647), but the open support button will still be a visible functionality difference between ErrorDialog and status dialog. Also, status dialog may display a link to the error log. It should be possible to easily remove those differences.
