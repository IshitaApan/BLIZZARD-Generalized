[DataBinding] Add support for IColorProvider, IFontProvider, and images for TableViewer

The 3.2m6 code doesn't provide support styling (colors, fonts, or images) in the TableViewer. The 3.2m5 code only allowed for one binding per columns, whether that be the display value, image, etc. Assumptions of the use cases are as follows: * The consumer will always want to provide a bound display property per column. * The consumer should be able to specify styling in addition to the bound display value. * The consumer could want to bind the style to one attribute in their model just like how display is bound. * The consumer could want a binding more complex than just one attribute (e.g. All males (gender) born before 01/01/2000 (birth date) are at higher risk therefore the row should be red). These rules could get complex depending upon the use case. My proposal is to support two modes: * Support binding to a single attribute like the current display binding. * Support the ability for a user defined label provider. If a label provider exists on the TableViewer at the time of binding it will be retrieved and treated like a delegate for unbound properties. This will allow for the support that the TableViewer provides today when not used in Data Binding. I'm currently working on this enhancement and will provide a patch when it's complete.
