[Perspectives] Placeholder with secondary ID is being relocated to false container causing views to show at false location

Suppose you create two placeholders in two different perspectives a) MyView:* (PerpectiveA) b) MyView:specialSecondaryId (PerspectiveB) then PartServiceImpl#addPart(MPart providedPart, MPart localPart) for MyView:specialSecondaryId tries to find the placeholder MyView:* and locates its container. From the provided part the placeholder is determined which has id MyView:specialSecondaryId and resides in perspectiveB. The method however does not care about this placeholder and relocates it to the container of placeholder MyView:*. The MyView:specialSecondaryId placeholder is thus being moved where it should not. I suppose a search for the exact placeholder must occur before any wildcard placeholder is being searched. Reading http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fui%2FIPageLayout.html indicates that placeholders with secondaryIds are valid.
