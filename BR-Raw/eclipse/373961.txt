BundleTranslationProvider should support new bundleclass://-style URIs

BundleTranslationProvider assumes that the contributorURI should be of the "platform:/plugin/XXXX" style. It thus skips performing any translations when provided a "bundleclass://" URI, such as might happen for a programmtically-contributed contribution that puts a URI to the contributing class. This could be seen in the Contacts demo, whose MenuThemeProcessor contributes the "Switch Theme" menu. Previously the contribution registered the menu element with a contributorURI of "bundleclass://org.eclipse.e4.demo.contacts", resulting in the menu appearing untranslated as '%switchThemeMenu'. Admittedly the "bundleclass://org.eclipse.e4.demo.contacts" doesn't quite make sense, since it doesn't specify a class, but it would make sense as "bundleclass://org.eclipse.e4.demo.contacts/org.eclipse.e4.demo.contacts.processors.MenuThemeProcessor I'll hack the contacts demo to specify a platform:/plugin-style contributorURI.
