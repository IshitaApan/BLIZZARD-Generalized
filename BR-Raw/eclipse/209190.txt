[Decorators] Request an overlay icon for symbolic links in the file system

As per bug 44107 comment 20: Symbolic links are an important concept of UNIX-linke file systems, and since Eclipse 3.3 the EFS file system is able to detect them. Especially for legacy projects, it is often very important to know what resources are actually a symbolic link. Eclipse IDE should provide visual feedback for the user, to see what resources are symbolic links. An overlay icon is suggested for this. Moreover, when looking at the Property page for a resource that's actually a symbolic link, the link target should be displayed in that property page. In order to accomplish the overlay icon with sufficient performance, it will be necessary to fix bug 44107 before this one can be fixed, since the attribute information whether a resource is a symbolic link or not needs to be cached.
