[Help] Add support for resolving hrefs in the workbench help system

There are several use cases where a help resource href needs to be resolved into a URL so that it can be manipulated (opened, shown in a browser etc.). This task is dependent on the help system plugged in. I have added two methods to IWorkbenchHelpSystem: resolve and unresolve. The former takes a String href and returns a resolved URL according to the active help system. The later takes a URL and returns the original href if the first part of the URL matches the base URL. The changes I made are backward-compatible in that AbstractHelpSystem has default implementations of the methods. Our own help implementation (DefaultHelpSystem) implements these methods in a non-trivial way. Please release the attached patch because Intro needs it in order to be able to embed help documents inside Intro pages.
