The BuildManager goes into an endless loop running the AutoBuildJob

The AutoBuildJob goes into an enless loop. This is happening when markers are being generated by the builder. The problems view is refreshing which in turn interrupts the AutoBuildJob thus causing the whole cycle to start over. Contact me directly if you need more info or a testcase.
