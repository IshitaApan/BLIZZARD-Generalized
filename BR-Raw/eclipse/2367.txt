add bookmark accepts empty string but does nothing (1GEUL6T)

AK (6/5/01 2:35:19 PM) 	you can put an empty string as a bookmark name - but the action does nothing then. 	emoty string should not be allowed. NOTES: GDA (6/5/01 12:08:06 PM) 	Defer. Not clear this is a JUI issue? 	Move to ui for kh to handle.
