[Progress] busy spinners are too fast

Only having used them for a few days I'm torn on whether the busy spinners in views provide more benefit than distraction, since the Italics of view titles already conveyed this information, and their taking a way the icon makes it harder for me to find the view by icon/color. Perhaps this wouldn't be as much of a problem if they overlayed over the existing icon rather than replacing it entirely. But there may be a UI design rationale here that I'm missing. However, if they remain could the animation be slowed down to the slow rate along the line of the internal browser's page loading animation? At the current fast rate the eye is constantly drawn to this distracting animation, whereas it seems like the only interesting events are when it has started, whether it is still going on when you check the view (often view element decorations show this), and when it stops.
