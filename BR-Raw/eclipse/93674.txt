[Dialogs] ProgressMonitorDialog not cancellable when fork is set to false

Overview Description: Invoking the ProgressMonitorDialog::run(boolean fork, boolean cancelable, IRunnableWithProgress runnable) method with the fork parameter set to false, the user can't cancel the running dialog -even if the cancelable parameter is set to true. Steps to Reproduce: Simply launch a ProgressMonitorDialog and invoke its run method with fork parameter == false and cancelable parameter == true Actual Results: The Cancel button is not responsive to user clicks and the IProgressMonitor::isCanceled() will always regardless. Expected Results: When the suer clicks the Cancel button on the dialog, calling IProgressMonitor::isCanceled() should return true so that the executing IRunnableWithProgress can have a chance to honour the user's request and exit.
