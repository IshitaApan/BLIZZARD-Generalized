[ViewMgmt] Placeholder folders are lost when multi-instance views are dragged

Created attachment 92570 Sample application Build ID: M20080221-1800 The attached example RCP application sets the perspective with a placeholder folder at the left of the editor area and adds all instances of the sample view in it. 1. Select File -> Open View and the view appears in the correct position. 2. Drag the view at the bottom of the editor area. 3. Select File -> Open View again, the new view appears at the right of the editor area, which is wrong. I would expect that it appeared on top of the previous view. Opening additional views makes it worse, seems that also the "default" location is lost as they appear all at the right of the editor area with reduced sizes, instead of on top of each other. If, after starting the application, I open two views and move only one of them, a third view appears in the correct position, on top of the view that wasn't moved. My suggestion is that the placeholders follows the location of the dragged view to some degree.
