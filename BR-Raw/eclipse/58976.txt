[EditorMgmt] (regression) Editor drop-down is missing asterisk

build I20040413 If you drop down the editor list when some editors are dirty, it's not immediately obvious which ones are dirty since the asterisk is placed at the end, not at the beginning. This is inconsistent with the tab presentation. This change was made because the asterisk was throwing off the sort order, but it should be possible to sort based on the editor input, and only adding the asterisk (at the beginning) when presenting the sorted list. I think this should be addressed for M9.
