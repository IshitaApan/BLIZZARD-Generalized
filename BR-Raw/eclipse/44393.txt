[Viewers] + shown in front of methods even if local types filter is on (different behaviour in outliner, members view and package explorer)

Test pass M4 - load JUnit - add an anonymous type to Assert#Assert - enable local type filter in Outliner observe: there is a plus in front of Assert which goes away when clicking on it. This might be JFace related but I would prefer that the plus is removed when the filter is switched on. - close Outliner - open Outliner observe: there isn't any plus sign in front of Assert - open Java Browsing perspective - enable local type filter in members view - select Assert class in Types view observe: the constructor Assert has a plus sign in front which goes away when clicking on it. - switch to another class - switch back to Assert observe: the constructor again has a plus sign in front. This is really annoying. The members view should at least behave like the outliner. - switch to package explorer - expand Assert - toggle local type filter observe: plus sign is added and removed correctly.
