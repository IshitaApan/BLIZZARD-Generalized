add a way to contribute object providers to dependency injection

The concrete example behind this enhancement is illustrated in the bug 304437 (adding "@Preferences" injection annotation). The general goal is to allow new injection annotations and sources of objects to be injected added to the DI mechanism without the need to modify "core" DI functionality or introduce dependencies between DI mechanism and specific types of objects being injected. The beginnings of this exist in the form of IObjectProvider / IObjectDescriptor pair of interfaces. However, that part of the code currently is in a very draft shape. We need: - Improve separation between contexts and injection - Make IObjectProvider / IObjectDescriptor interfaces functional and more generic - Add a way to contribute IObjectProvider / IObjectDescriptor implementations for consumer-defined annotations - Make context injection and JSR 330 injection use this mechanism - Add preferences injection using the new mechanism
