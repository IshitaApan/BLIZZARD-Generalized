[WorkingSets] Select Working Sets is not "exlusive"

I discovered the great new feature "window working set" in eclipse 3.2 and started to use it. Previously I used the working sets manually in each perspective like "package explorer". The old behaviour was, that I selected a new working set and the previous one was automatically deselected. It was a "switch working set" operation. The window working set has a new behaviour. I select another working set and see thereofore two working sets at the same time in the package explorer. Now I have to use the window working set a second time and deselect the previous working set. I have to click twice for the same behaviour as before. Is there a hidden workaround to perform a "switch working set" operation with window working set by only selecting "window working set" once?
