[Browser] web browser preference page text does not flow

3.3M5, just an aestetic thing The text at the top of the preference page does not look good on linux because it appears to have a hard return after its comma, which is in the middle of a line. Also, when the dialog's size is expanded the text does not re-lay itself out, which makes it look more awkward. The Label should have SWT.WRAP style, no hard return after the comma, and _may_ need some layout data to tell it to grab available horizontal space.
