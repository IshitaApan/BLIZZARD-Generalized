[Contributions] Need methods to notify show/hide toolbar and statusline to ActionBarAdvisor

Created attachment 79091 Proposed patch We are creating a RCP app supporting a custom CoolBar and a custom StatusLine widgets. We have our own createWindowContents( ) in our own WorkbenchWindowAdvisor, so the custom CoolBar and custom StatusLine are created in the window advisor. The current issue is, we don't know when WorkenchWindow.setCoolBarVisible( ) or WorkbenchWIndow.setStatusLineVisible( ), so we cannot show/hide our CoolBar and StatusLine widgets when WorkbenchWindow.setCoolBarVisible( ) or WorkbenchWindow.setStatusLineVisible( ) is called. We would like to have some methods to notify show/hide toolbar and statusline to the rcp app via ActionBarAdvisor. Please see the attached proposed patch.
