[KeyBindings] END/HOME keys are not behaving as expected when the content assist pop up is activated

Open a Java file and invoke content assist anywhere in the code. Once the content assist pop up is activated, if user press END key, it is expected that the last option in the content assist pop up gets selected, similar behavior is expected for HOME key where it selects the first option available in the content assist pop up window. This works in Eclipse 3.8.1, but from Eclipse 4.2 this seems broken.
