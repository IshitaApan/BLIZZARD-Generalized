[Undo/Redo] Asian language Undo and Redo menus have quick key in wrong location when Action is appended

When we have quick keys like &Undo and &Redo in languages like English and German, this is not a problem. However in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, we do not have an underlined character. Instead the quick key is written out in parenthesis like this: (U) in the case of Undo for example. We do not have a problem when no action is in the Undo Redo queue. The (U) and the (R) are in the right location (following the translated word for Undo and Redo). We do have a problem when an Action is in the Undo Redo Queue. For example, in English we would have an Action called "Add Statement" and the menu item for Undo is generated to say (assume an underlined U) "Undo Add Statement", likely via something that looks like this...&Undo {0} In Asian translations, the issue we are seeing is that the (U) and (R) come in the middle of the visible string. The attachment will show this. It is possible the properties file lists /xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx (U) {0} instead of /xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx {0} (U) or something along that line.
