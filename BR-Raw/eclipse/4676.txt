[Navigator] Tree scroll bar out of sync with top item (1GEJYGD)

The Tree scroll bar can get out of sync with the top item on Linux. To reproduce in Eclipse: 1. Open a standard SWT development workspace with the UIMain launcher loaded 	(org.eclipse.core.launcher should be the first project in the tree). 2. Expand the project to display the UIMain class and select it. 3. Exit Eclipse and restart. ->UIMain is selected and the top item. The scroll bar is also at the top/position 0. When you click the scroll bar the tree gets in sync with the scroll bar and shows the first tree item as the top item (the launcher project). NOTES: 	McQ (01/06/2001 9:02:42 AM) - 		Scrollbar needs to be forced to update its position. Is this 		a Tree problem or an ITPUI bug? 	KR (6/1/01 11:39:31 AM) 		It's the tree - only happens on Linux. 	KR (6/1/01 2:02:13 PM) 		Note that this is only reproducable when there are no editors open. 		It seems that the selected item is the top item and that the scroll bar is 		set as if the top item from the last Eclipse session was still the top item. 	McQ (01/06/2001 4:18:41 PM) - 		Re "It's the tree - only happens on Linux.": We have already had several cases 		where they assumed that by working with the scroll bar directly they could get 		widgets to position their contents, which works some places and not others 		(and thus is not supported). This could be a similar case. 	KR (6/4/01 11:42:26 AM) 		After debugging this for a while I noticed that a bunch of viewers call Tree.getVerticalBar() 		to restore the old ui state. This is one of the cases where this doesn't work. 		Tree.setSelection is called to select the previously selected item (at index 10). This automatically 		sets the top index and the scroll bar selection to 10. 		Someone (PackageExplorerPart.restoreState) then gets the vertical scroll bar and sets its 		selection to 9. For some reason the Tree doesn't always update the top index accordingly. 	KR (6/4/01 12:30:28 PM) 		It seems that the Tree sometimes gets a selection event for the programmatic scroll bar selection 		but most of the time doesn't. 	McQ (05/06/2001 11:04:29 AM) - 		No further action for June. 	McQ (26/06/2001 2:19:17 PM) - 		Time to take another look at this.
