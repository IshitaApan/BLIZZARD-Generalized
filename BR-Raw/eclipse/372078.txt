Injections during execution of MDirectMenuItem contribution object do not receive UI element

Created attachment 211295 patch to DirectContributionItem and tests HandledContributionItem and DirectContributionItem deviate in the contexts used to populate their handler objects on execution. HandledContributionItem, on widget selection, uses ContributionsAnalyzer.populateModelInterfaces() to populate the contribution's context with the item model object using the item model class' interface hierarchy. It also uses the active part's context for the primary injection context. DirectContributionItem only populates the context with the MItem, and uses the context from the item's ancestry as the primary injection context. The attached patch changes DirectContributionItem to act like HandledContributionItem to create a static context populated with the item model class' interface hierarchy, used for the secondary context during injection. It leaves the primary context unchanged as the surrounding element's context, rather than the leaf context.
