[Import/Export] Flashing Cursor appears in description in Eclipse 2.1.1

A flashing cursor appears in the description of many Wizard Pages. For example, the File->Import Wizard. It also occurs on many of our WSAD wizards. Also, you can click on the description, and have the cursor placed there. I'm not sure if this is desired behaviour or not. This is with Eclipse 2.1.1
