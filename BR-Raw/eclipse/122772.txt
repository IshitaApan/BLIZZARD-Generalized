[Wizards] NewWizardAction would be able to customize the title and description of the opened wizard

At the moment, it possible to restrict the content of the New wizard to a given category of elements using the org.eclipse.ui.actions.NewWizardAction. Nevertheless, it is impossible to change the title neither the description of the wizard that is open by the action. It would be much more user friendly that instances of NewWizardAction that are usually displayed in the New sub menu like "XXXX..." open a wizard with a title such as "New XXXX". This the case for projects where an action "Project..." pops up a wizard titled "New Project". It has not be implemented using NewWizardAction due to this limitation (I guess). The solution has been to put the setting of the correct wizard title in NewWizard.init() according to an internal flag that is set in the NewProjectAction.run() method. This enhancement is required in TPTP (see #110714).
