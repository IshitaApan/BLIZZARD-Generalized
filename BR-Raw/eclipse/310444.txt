[LinkedResources] Drag and Drop dialogs not disabled when Linked Resources turned off

I20100425-2000 - on the 'Linked Resources' preference page, disable the checkbox => DND groups are still enabled (should be disabled) - click OK - drag a file from the OS to the Package Explorer, Resource Navigator,... => "File Operation" dialog is still shown (should not be shown and just make a copy). Selecting "Link to files" gives an error dialog after I clicked OK. Additional UI problems on the preference page: - groups don't use dialog font - missing vertical gap between checkbox and first DND group: The gap should have the same size as the gap between the second group and the "Path variables..." label. Currently, the visual clustering suggests that the checkbox only applies to the DND groups.
