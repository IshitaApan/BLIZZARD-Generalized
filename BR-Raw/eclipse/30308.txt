[Decorators] Flashing viewer refresh

build 20030121 -I have a workspace with the UI plugins and the org.eclipse.swt/org.eclipse.swt.win32 plugins (v2122c/v2122) loaded. -Searched all .java files for "formatName" -Got six results in org.eclipse.swt.dnd.Transfer.java (different files and versions for different platforms) ->Double clicking on a search result causes flashing refreshes in the search results view and in the outliner. It looks like the version number decoration gets added and removed in an infinite loop. I have the default team label decorators enabled and all team icon decorators disabled.
