[JFace] initial size & location of Window is never set if a menu bar is displayed

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: If you create a ApplicationWindow with a menu bar, the initializeBounds() breaks before it calls getInitialSize() and getInitialLocation(). Please see the attached snippet: It first shows an ApplicationWindow without menu bar. initializeBounds() runs correct. After closing this window, it shows an ApplicationWindow with menu bar. Now initializeBounds() breaks to early and don't call getInitialSize() and getInitialLocation(). The problem is that createTrimWidgets() in ApplicationWindow create a shell resize event which lets initializeBounds() break. Reproducible: Always
