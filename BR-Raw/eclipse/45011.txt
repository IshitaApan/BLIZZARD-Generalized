[Jobs] NPE in UIJob while running UI test suites

I get the following stack trace in my console when I run the UI test suites: !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Oct 16, 2003 09:42:48.296 !MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: "Update for Decoration Completion". !STACK 0 java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.getDisplay(UIJob.java:121) 	at org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.run(UIJob.java:69) 	at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:62) It didn't cause a test failure and it doesn't happen consistantly.
