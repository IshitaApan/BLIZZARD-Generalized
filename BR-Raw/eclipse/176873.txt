[Preferences] ColorFieldEditor should not set button size to IDialogConstants.BUTTON_WIDTH

The ColorFieldEditor shouldn't adjust the size of the button that is created by ColorSelector. ColorFieldEditor#doFillIntoGrid(...) creates a ColorSelector and then increases the size of the button using IDialogConstants.BUTTON_WIDTH. This creates buttons that are oversized and unattractive. Worse, this means that Eclipse preference pages don't present a color selector with a consistent size. Pages which use the JFace API to create a ColorSelector directly get a button that's one size, while pages which use the ColorFieldEditor get something else. The current workaround allows us to use ColorFieldEditor without the undesirable missizing: new ColorFieldEditor(preference, label, parent) { protected void doFillIntoGrid(Composite parent, int numColumns) { super.doFillInfoGrid(parent, numColumns); getChangeControl(parent).setLayoutData(new GridData()); } }
