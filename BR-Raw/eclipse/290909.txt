ISizeProvider client contract unclear

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: 3.5.1 The interface ISizeProvider has an @noimplement annotation saying "This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.". On the other hand the official documentation of IViewPart says: "As of 3.4, views may optionally adapt to {@link ISizeProvider} if they have a preferred size.[..]" Several bugzilla entries (e.g. #104234, #151715, #189939) are referring to this capability as part of a solution, so it seems that this description is either outdated or incorrect.
