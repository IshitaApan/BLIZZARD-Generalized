[Contributions] Spec clarification: ContributionItem.getParent() can return null

build I20050420 ContributionItem.getParent() is spec'ed to not return null: /** * Returns the parent contribution manager. * * @return the parent contribution manager * @since 2.0 */ public IContributionManager getParent() ... However, it can return null if the item has not yet been added to a contribution manager (this has always been true), or after it has been removed from the manager (true since 3.1 due to fix for bug 80569).
