[Workbench] 3.6.2 RCP application does not run correctly on 4.3 (workbench window is launching)

Created attachment 233532 Test project that shows the incorrect behavior I have an 3.6.2 RCP application that is basically a jface wizard. I need a workbench only so I can use the help system. I only want the jface wizard launched I don't want the workbench launched. To get this to only show the wizard on 3.6.2 I implemented the postStartup() method my ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor class. It basically did the creation of the wizard and launched it. I needed to setBlockOnOpen to false so that I could use progress monitors (indeterminate) in the application. Now I moved to a 4.3 eclipse base and tried to run this 3.6.2 application from that. It no longer works. The behavior in 4.3 is that is shows the workbench window as well as my jface wizard. I am stumped as to how to fix this. I have attached a small sample application that shows this issue. Note: If I set setBlockOnOpen(true) then I don't see the workbench window but then my progress monitors (indeterminate) no longer work. So that is not an option. I need help asap as I have a schedule to make in a couple of weeks.
