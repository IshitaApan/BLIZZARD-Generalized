[Workbench] Initial size from IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer is not used to create the workbench window

In our application (IBM Installation Manager), we override 'preWindowOpen()' in 'WorkbenchWindowAdvisor' to set initial size to IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer (e.g. IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer.setInitialSize(lastSessionIMSize)) . But this initial size is not used to create the workbench window after we moved our target environment to Eclipse 4.2.1. It used to work before our E4 adoption.
