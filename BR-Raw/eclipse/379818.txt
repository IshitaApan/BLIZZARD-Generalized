Inconsistent activation of views

Created attachment 215779 Partial transition between JUnit and Variables view Build Id: N20120421-2021 1. I have JUnit and Variables (from debug) views in the same stack - this stack is in a detached window, but I don't think this matters 2. I'm running tests in debug perspective 3. JUnit view is active and shows progress 4. Tests stop at a breakpoint 5. JUnit view becomes empty (white - whatever white means in 4.2) 6. I click into the view Effect: the variables view is activated and now renders. The state (5) is broken, that stack doesn't show any information. I'm not sure if this is a problem in Platform UI or Debug UI. I've seen empty views quite frequently, which need to be clicked into to force rendering. However, this case is even worse, as the stack still shows the JUnit view as active. I just verified that Build I20120514-1900 basically has the same problem.
