[IDE] [Wizards] Improvements to the advanced section of new folder wizard

I like the virtual folder presentation in bug 296565. However I found myself wanting to see the default location presented somewhere when moving between the radios. Perhaps it's good enough to include a parenthetical location such as [ ] Use default location (c:\workspace\foo\bar) The other idea was to show the resultant location in a location box that could be disabled and enabled as the link resource group is done today. This probably requires changing the layout so that the linked resource group is positioned even with the radios, rather than as a subset of linked option. Also, it requires code to cache the last user-specified location so that it can be restored whenever the link option is reselected.
