[Intro] When new welcome is available, don't show the old one

One of the M8 candidate builds (any): 1) Open Eclipse on a new workspace 2) Close the new Welcome when it opens 3) Close Eclipse 4) Open Eclipse again. Observe: the old Welcome editor is opened. Expectation: when a product has a valid Intro, old welcome should never be shown.
