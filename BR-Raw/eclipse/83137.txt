[ActivityMgmt] EditorAction contribution ignored if editor is first displayed with capability disabled

- Define an org.eclipse.ui.editorActions extension point in a test plugin. Target a generic editor (ex the Java editor) which is not connected with the test plugin. - Add the test plugin to a new "Test" capability which is disabled by default. - Start runtime. - Ensure that the "Test" capability is disabled. - Perform actions necessary to display the editor. (Make sure that this action does not enable the "Test" capability. Result: added editorAction is not visible (Is this Expected?? I'd prefer that the editorAction was shown as disabled) - Enable "Test" capability. Result: the editorAction is still not visible. Once the capability is enabled, the editorAction should be made available. - Attempt to close and reopen the editor Result: no change. editorAction is still not visible. - Cloase all editors and Shut down and Restart eclipse. - Enable "Test" capability - Perform necessary actions to display the editor. Result: editorAction is visible. It appears that if the editor was first initialized/displayed when the capability was disabled, all editorActions contributions made by the affected plugins will be ignored forever. Even when the capability is enabled the editorActions are not made visible on the toolbar.
