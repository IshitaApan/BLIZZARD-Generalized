[UI] Remove Menu/TB creation from the PartRenderer

The code currently 'automatically' creates any defined menu or toolbar in the model as direct children of the newly rendered part. This is incorrect in that a part's menu/toolbar is 'hosted' by its parent part (i.e. a view's toolbar is managed by its containing CTabFolder). It also ends up with a toolbar 'floating' on top of the view in the compatibility layer. We should remove this code and leave the management of the menu and toolbar to the various part factories themselves.
