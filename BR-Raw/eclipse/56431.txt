[ViewMgmt] Placeholder is lost when a multi-view instanced view is opened

Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a placeholder for a view that supports multiple instances. 2) Open the view programmatically with page.showView(.... 3) Open another instance of the same view. Bug: The perpsective presentation opens the second instance of the view in what it considers to be the "bottomRight" container. One would expect that all instances of this view would be opened relative to the placeholder. This is critical for LWP. If no workaround is available, this is a show stopper. -m@
