[KeyBindings] Exporting key preferences to CSV does not allow context being null

This fix needs to be in 3.6 PW +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #295557 +++ User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.15) Gecko/2009101601 Firefox/3.0.15 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: M20090917-0800 When exporting key preferences to CSV a NPE occurs when the context of one of the keys is null. The context being null is already considered for instance within BindingElementLabelProvider: ModelElement context = bindingElement.getContext(); return context == null ? Util.ZERO_LENGTH_STRING : context.getName(); In the same way it should be considered within KeyController, where the NPE comes from: buffer.append(ESCAPED_QUOTE + be.getContext().getName() + ESCAPED_QUOTE); Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Only happens, when a key is listed without context 2. Could not reproduce with plain eclipse, because there is no key without context listet by default
