Remove 4.x workbench dependency on equinox.concurrent

There are some trivial references to org.eclipse.equinox.concurrent in org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench and org.eclipse.e4.core.services. I think we should just remove these rather than bringing in a new dependency. They are used to define and register a ISchedulingExecutor service but nobody ever uses it. The reason I think it is worth removing them is this was investigation that was started long ago but never made much progress. The org.eclipse.e4.core.services.work package is in a similar state, and defines its own Future API that duplicates the work in org.eclipse.equinox.concurrent (and java.util.concurrent for that matter). Once we add a bundle to our RCP feature it is quite difficult to remove in the future. I have a patch ready but was wondering if anyone else has seen evidence of ISchedulingExecutor being used by anyone.
