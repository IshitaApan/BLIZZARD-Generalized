[Perspectives] 2.1 -> 3.0 Can delete the Debug perspective

In a 2.1 environment, create a preference file such that the 2.1 Debug perspective was modified and saved as the Debug perspective (i.e. Save Perspective As -> Debug). I have attached a preference file from 2.1 that does just that. In a 3.0 environment, load this preference file. Try to open the Debug perspective. This causes errors because the view ConsoleView from the 2.1 Debug perspective no longer exists. If you look at the list of perspectives now available to you (Window->Open Perspective->Other...) you will notice that the Debug perspective is no longer listed. UI removed all perspectives with that id because a problem was encountered opening that perspective. Workaround - There is a ray of sunshine, however. If you shutdown Eclipse and start it up again, the 3.0 Debug perspective is reloaded and available to you.
