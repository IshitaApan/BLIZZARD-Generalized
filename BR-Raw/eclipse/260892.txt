[CellEditors] NPE from ColumnViewerEditor caused by showing a dialog during modify

Created attachment 122432 Interactive test Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: Run the interactive test provided. The first cell can be modified, but the second cannot. Click on the first cell to start a cell editor, then click on the second cell. A dialog is shown - in our application this might indicate that the value entered into the cell was not valid. After dismissing the dialog there is an NPE. More information: It appears that 'cell' in ColumnViewerEditor is nulled when the second, unmodifiable, cell is selected. Either it shouldn't have been nulled at this time or a guard is needed. The code which NPE's is the first line of: --- if( ! this.cell.getItem().isDisposed() ) { this.cell.getItem().removeDisposeListener(disposeListener); } ---
