[Working Sets] WorkingSetManager sending bogus property change event

build R2.0 The WorkingSetManager.removeWorkingSet sends a CHANGE_WORKING_SET_REMOVE event even if a removed working set does not exist in the list of working sets. WorkingSetManager.removeWorkingSet should ignore the remove request when the working set does not exist. Commented out failing test case in IWorkingSetManagerTest.testAddPropertyChangeListener. Add back when this bug is fixed.
