[Wizards] ZipFileImportWizard should allow configuration of supported file extensions

When selecting the source ZIP file, the user hits the "Browse..." button which opens the File Open Dialog. The file extensions are set to *.jar, *.zip There are other files such as *.war files which are in ZIP format and it would be nice to ehance the ZipFileImportWizard so that these extensions are read from a configuration/properties file. Currently, they are hardcoded in org/eclipse/ui/wizards/datatransfer/WizardZipFileResourceImportPage1.java
