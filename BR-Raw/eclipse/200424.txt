[Undo] Undo operation deletes a file from the file system

Build ID: I20070621-1340 Steps To Reproduce: 1) Open an Eclipse workspace 2) Create a new file, type some text, save it, close it 3) Reopen that file and leave it open 4) With the editor in focus, go to File, New in the menu and create a new file. 5) Type some text into the new file and save it. Leave the file open. 6) Click the tab on the first file and press ctrl+z. You can see the second file's tab disappears without any notification. If you look in Package Explorer and in your file system, the file no longer exists. More information: You can get the second file back by clicking on the Package Explorer pane and selecting Edit, Redo in the menu (if you do this before doing anything else!). However, it is quite unnerving to see a file which you have spent a lot of time creating suddenly vanish. The redo option also does not appear while the text editor is in focus.
