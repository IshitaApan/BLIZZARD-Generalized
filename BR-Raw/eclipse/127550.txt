[Progress] Little text centred in a big view

I20060213-0800, GTK+ 2.8.8, KDE 3.4.3, X.org 6.8.2, Linux 2.6.14 There is a little piece of text in the centre of the progress view if I open when nothing is running. This text looks a little out of place left horizontally aligned, and centre vertically aligned in a rather large sea of white space.
