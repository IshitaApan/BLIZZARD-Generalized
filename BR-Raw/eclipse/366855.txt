MenuHelper.getIconURI() has no provision for non-File- or URL-based imagedescriptors

Created attachment 208463 Patch to MenuHelper Build: 4.2M4 I have an editor that adds actions to the toolbar. These actions are actually wrapped instances of Swing/AWT Action objects, and have a custom ImageDescriptor that wraps a Swing IconImage. Although this ImageDescriptor actually has a URL, but MenuHelper#getIconURI() specifically only handles FileImageDescriptor and URLImageDescriptor. As a result, the actions are treated as if it has no icon, and the action text is shown instead. I think we should enhance MenuHelper#getIconURI() to use the adapter manager framework, so as to provide an opportunity for non-{File,URL}ImageDescriptors to provide a URL/URI.
