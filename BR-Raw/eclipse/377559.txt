menuContribution not working in Juno, but works fine in Eclipse 3.7

Build Identifier: Version: Juno Release Build id: 20120322-1740 I'm using the menuContribution element of the org.eclipse.ui.menus extension to contribute an action to the Show in menu item. This extension work fine in Eclipse 3.7, but in Eclipse 4.2 the action doesn't come up at all. Attached to the defect is a zip file that contains a stripped down version of my plugin that can be used to reproduce this problem. I have also attached two screen shots which show what is displayed in Eclipse 3.7 and what is displayed in Eclipse 4.2. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start with an Eclipse 3.7 base 2. Import the attached plugin project. 3. Launch a self host version of Eclipse that includes this plugin. 4. Create a project in this self host workspace. 5. Right click on this project and select "Show in" 6. Notice that there is a "Test Menu" submenu. 7. Repeat steps 1 to 5 above for Eclipse 4.2. 8. In this case the "Test Menu" submenu does not appear.
