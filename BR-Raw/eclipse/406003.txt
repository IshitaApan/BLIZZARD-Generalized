Persisting bindings forever results in bad/conflicting bindings that cannot be removed

Every key binding that is loaded from the bindings extension is persisted in the workbench xmi. If the plug-in providing that extension is later removed, the keybinding stays. Worse is that the keys pref page doesn't recognize the conflict. The only workaround is to delete the xmi file or start a new workspace. 1) Create a new plug-in project > Create an RCP > Use the Mail RCP Template 2) Launch a normal Eclipse application launch (runtime workbench) 3) Note that CTRL+X will close Eclipse instead of copy 4) Note that CTRL+3 has a conflict (Quick Access and Open Message) 5) Shut down the runtime workbench 6) Close or delete the Mail RCP project 7) Launch the runtime workbench again Result: CTRL+X still shuts down Eclipse! CTRL+3 still has a conflict The preference page doesn't list any conflicts for those keybindings
