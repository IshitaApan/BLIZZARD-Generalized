[UI] Need to detect selecting an already selected tab as an 'activate' event

Currently we can detect activation at the contributed part level and when the user selects a currently unselected tab in a stack but the case where the user clicks on the currently selected tab isn't picked up. We need to pick up this case so we can manage the CSS styles correctly.
