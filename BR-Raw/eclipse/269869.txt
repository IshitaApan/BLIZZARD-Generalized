[Markers] No "Restore Defaults" button in filter dialog for ProblemsView

After trying to configure the ProblemsView with various filters, I noticed that there is no "Restore Defaults" button in many of the dialogs used for filtering views. Some examples include: ProblemsView > "Configure Contents..." (Problems View) PackageExplorerPart > "Filters..." (Package Explorer) CommonNavigator > "Customize View..." (Project Explorer) I know this is probably an enhancement request rather than a bug report, but I think that from a usability standpoint, you should be able to reset a view's filter(s) back to the default without having to reset the perspective. Also, would like to note that the reason why I'm posting this bug is because just then, when trying to filter the problems view to show errors/warnings "On selected element only", it at first did not give me the results I expected. After trying to get the filters back to show errors in the entire workspace, absolutely zero problems were showing up in my view.
