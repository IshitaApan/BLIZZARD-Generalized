[Preferences] PreferencesUtil.createPreferenceDialogOn should place focus on the preference page

Build ID: 3.4.0.I20080521-2000 Steps To Reproduce: Use PreferencesUtil.createPreferenceDialogOn to open a specific preference page. When the preferences dialog opens, focus is in the filter text control ("type filter text"). Issue: Focus should be on the preference page so a blind user using screen reader knows where they are and what to do next. More information:
