TrimmedPartLayout does not respect origin of client area

Currently the TrimmedPartLayout only respects width and height of the client area to layout the composites. The layout cannot expect that the client area is always located at 0,0 (even though in SWT most of the time it is). We should respect the location of the clientarea while computing the layout.
