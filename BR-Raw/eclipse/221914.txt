[Workbench] Need enhancement to WorkbenchPage API

Build ID: I20080207-1530 Steps To Reproduce: We have an RCP application that needs to activate a specified perspective B when closing perspective A. Currently when you close a perspective, if the perspective was active and not the only perspective open then the policy is such that the last opened perspective is activated. We have a requirement to override this policy in some cases and specify a known perspective to open. We think the simplest way to implement this support for 3.4 is to enhance the WorkbenchPage API to allow clients to specify a perspective B to activate when the specified perspective A is closed. Attaching a patch that implements this feature. I did not promote the API to IWorkbenchPage as I feel that 3.4 may be close to API freeze and one alternative is to support this method in WorkbenchPage with the understanding that it is provisional.
