[Compatibility] "Compare With" always done on same file regardless of selection

Eclipse EGit	1.2.0.201111160714 Eclipse SDK	4.2.0.I20111116-0810 Perhaps related to Bug 358020. I had a case yesterday where I was selecting a (git) file in the Package Explorer and doing a Compare With -> Branch, Tag or Reference. I would choose a tag to compare with but when the compare view opened, the compare was being done on a different file altogether. I tried it multiple times but it consistently compared against the same wrong file. I talked to John and he pointed out the path was incorrect in the top of the compare dialog and mentioned there was a perhaps related problem recently fixed (Bug 358020) in and around selection changes in views. I don't have reproducible steps yet but I had been using the Commit view, History view, and others.
