[GTK2.18] Clicking in hover help eats left clicks for entire X session

Eclipse SDK 3.5.1 with Mylyn 3.2.2 Linux/Gtk x86_64 (Fedora 12 with gtk2-2.18.5-4.fc12.x86_64) The following happens both with and without GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=true. I can't make it happen in a VNC session with gtk 2.18 nor can I make it happen in a VNC session with gtk 2.16. For gtk 2.16, it appears that this clicking behaviour results in a click-drag or click-copy operation (I'm sure I'm using incorrect terminology there ;). - extend your Eclipse window vertically to the bottom of your display area - have a task list with a bunch of tasks - put your mouse cursor over the last item in the list - notice that the hoverhelp information appears over where your cursor is located - left click in the hover area This results in the inability to left click anywhere else in desktop. I have to restart X to get left clicking back.
