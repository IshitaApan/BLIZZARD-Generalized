[About] Unable to open web browser: Help->About Eclipse Platform->Feature Details->More Info

Platforms: Solaris 9 and HP-UX11.11 Eclipse 3.0M8, Build Id: 200403261517 First I will prove that I can open the web browser via Eclipse Help: - Go to Window->Preferences->Help. Enter in the browser's path and command (e.g <path>/netscape %1) into "Customer Browser command". Click OK. - Go to Help->Help Contents. The browser opens with Eclipse Help System content. The browser is working O.K. I now go to Help again: - Help->About Eclipse Platform->Feature Details. Select an item and click 'More Info'. An error dialog box comes up with an "Unable to open web browser" message. Same with Help->About Eclipse Platform->Plug-in Details Is there any place on Eclipse that I can set the 'More Info' web browser preference?
