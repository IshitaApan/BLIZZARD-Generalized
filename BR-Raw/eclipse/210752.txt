[Viewers]Cannot use custom CellNavigationStrategy  in TableViewerFocusCellManager

Build ID: I20070621-1340 Steps To Reproduce: We need to use custom CellNavigationStrategy, where the next selected cell is chosen with respect to model elements. But we have run into the problem that even if CellNavigationStrategy is public, so we can by all means customize it as we wish(by subclassing), we are not able to use this customized instance in TableViewerFocusCellManager because there is no way how to set it(it's private). So we propose that the TableViewerFocusCellManager will have the ability to use user defined instance of CellNavigationStrategy(maybe set in costructor). More information:
