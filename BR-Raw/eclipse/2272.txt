Steps: 1) create a new project 2) in the Navigator, right click on the project and click 'Close Project' 3) right click on the project and click 'Copy Project' 4) enter a new name and click OK The workbench will not allow this action, so the menu item should be disabled for this item, or it should be allowed.
