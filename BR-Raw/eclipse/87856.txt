[Commands] Last closed editor leaked due to reference by command manager

You need code from HEAD (or upcoming I20050315-0800) to see the problem because before that point every opened editor was leaked (see bug 87796). The attached reference graph shows that the command manager holds on to a command which still holds on to handlers provided by the closed editor. I don't know the command code that well but it looks like a problem in the WorkbenchCommandManager: when a handler submission gets removed and there's no new handler for it's command ID then the command holds on to the old handler: removeHandlerSubmissionReal(...) removes the commandId from handlerSubmissionsByCommandId ==> handlersByCommandId in processHandlerSubmissions(...) will not contain the removed commandId ==> commandManagerWrapper.setHandlersByCommandId(handlersByCommandId) which is called in processHandlerSubmissions(...) will not reset the handler in the Command for the removed commandId
