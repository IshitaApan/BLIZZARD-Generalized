[Undo] NPE in OperationHistoryActionHandler

This can happen during the shutdown of the workbench window. It happens because of the reference to the window after it's gone to get the history. This is all done in an async task which might run once the window is gone. It's only annoying because it makes scary looking messages in the log. I have a headless test suite that makes this happen at will, as it creates/destroys workbench windows with each test case.
