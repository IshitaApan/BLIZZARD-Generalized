[Navigator] Adding a nature with associated natureImage does not refresh folder overlay.

I have a nature with my own natureImage associated with it. I wrote a Wizard to "convert" exisiting projects to contain my nature. Everything works fine, but the overlay icon does not show on the project folder until I do one of the following: 1) restart the workbench 2) "Go into" and back out of the project folder 3) Close and re-open the project Refreshing the project folder does not help, nor does refreshing the workspace. I can see of no way to cause this hard repaint of the folder icon to happen within the API but I could be missing something. If there is a way to do it I would be happy to hear it. ;o)
