[FastView] Parts of eclipse window become a light blue square and don't get repainted.

I have run into this both on 4.4 M2 and Version: 4.4.0 Build id: N20131014-2005 Suddenly (don't recall a fixed pattern of user action preceding the event) a part of eclipse window becomes a light blue blank square (I am on Windows 64, default out of the box color schemes if that matters) and does not refresh itself anymore. On one occasion, the size of this area was half the overall screen, at other times, perhaps a quarter. Minimize/maximize, resize the subwindows, reset perspective etc don't help. I have to shutdown eclipse and restart for it to go away. Somehow some widget is losing track of its size or is not responding to repaint event - may be. If this is a platform/ui issue, please reassign. This makes M2 pretty unusable for me actually.
