Odd view tab resizing

Created attachment 199145 sequence of resizing workbench window's effect on view tab Build: Eclipse 4.1 (I20110620-1631) on Linux (Fedora 15 x86_64) Gtk (2.24.4) If I play with the width of my Eclipse 4.1 window, the outline view tab shrinks in odd ways. I'll attach an illustrative screenshot. I took a short video but it seems to have dropped some frames so it's probably not as useful as I'd hoped (and I don't know if the viewer of this bug can view webm videos :) : http://fedorapeople.org/~overholt/tabresize.webm I've looked at the behaviour of other applications: Firefox - tabs never get smaller than a certain width - entire window shrinks to almost 0 pixels wide Empathy - tabs never shrink to smaller than a certain width - number of tabs visible depends on width of window - window cannot be shrunk to smaller than minimum width of one tab
