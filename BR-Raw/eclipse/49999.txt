[Jobs] Behavior of new Job error dialog

I20040113 We had an error in one of our jobs which runs when the selection changes. This caused the new Job error dialog to appear. But first I could not close it since it was automatically reopened when the editor got focus. After I noticed that the dialog isn't modal I could close it by first selecting another editor. There should be a way to minimize the dialog and then later bring it up again.
