New project location dialog misleading

There have been many reports of people creating new projects and specifying non default content locations getting confused and specifying the parent of the location rather than the location itself. For example, a typical user wanting to create a project Foo and have it actually live in c:\projects\foo, will uncheck the "use default location" box and then use the Browse button to get select a location. They will then navigate as far as they can (i.e., to the c:\projects dir) and say ok. On returning to the main dialog they see the selected location in the location text field and click ok. Unfortunately, this did not create Foo in c:\projects\Foo as they expect/figured. It created Foo but Foo's content area is c:\projects. Of course, they then try to delete the project and delete much more than they expected... The file browser presented when using the Browse... button is less than optimal. It does not allow users to create new folders. In this scenario the user is not presented with any alternative so the naturally figure that Eclipse will do the right thing for them and append on the project name. In addition, different wording in the dialog may help. For example, rather than talking of "Content location", perhaps using "Project root" or some such would be more specific that this is the root of the project not the parent of the root. Another alternative is to automatically append the name of the project on the end of the path selected using the Browse... option. While this may not be the actual correct string in all cases, it will be correct in many cases and it does drive home to the user that the location path is the FULL path to the root of the project not the parent of the root.
