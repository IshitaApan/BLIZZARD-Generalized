[Model] Unused parameter / field in DeferredTreeContentManager

We are adapting our deferred content providers to be ITreePathContentProviders instead of ITreeContentProviders. Unfortunately there is no DeferredTreeContentManager for ITreePathContentProviders. But from my review of the code there appears to be no reason for the DeferredTreeContentManager to require an ITreeContentProvider to be passed into the contructor. The field is set but never used. Seems to be historical remnant from before the IDeferredWorkbenchAdapter?? It would be great if a constructor was added that did not require a content provider. I would suggest at least javadoc that null can be passed in for the content provider to allow for cases where you do not have an ITreeContentProvider. Also I believe the javadoc for getChildren is incorrect for the @return
