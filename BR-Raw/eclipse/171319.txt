[KeyBindings] IActionDelegate with key binding misses active editor

Build ID: M20060921-0945 While trying to use an IEditorActionDelegate with key binding one of the action instances does not get informed about the changed active editor. Situation: I have an action implementing IEditorActionDelegate contributed to org.eclipse.ui.editorActions. This action defines a definitionId pointing to a command which points to a category. Additionally I registered a key binding at org.eclipse.ui.bindings which points to the above mentioned command. Steps To Reproduce: Step 1: I open a new editor (A) which the action is contributed to. -> The mentioned action above is being created and the method setActiveEditor(IAction action, IEditorPart targetEditor) is being called. Step 2: I open another instance of the same editor (B). -> the action is notified about the new "active" editor Step 3: I now press the defined key combination. -> a new action is created again. and the action's setActiveEditor is called with editor B's reference as parameter. Step 4: Then I switch back to editor A. -> Only the action created at first is notified about the editor change. -> The second action still points to the "inactive" editor. Step 5: It gets even worse if I close editor B. -> the second action points to the disposed editor B then. Conclusion: The keybinding ActionHandler calls setActiveEditor only once and never again.
