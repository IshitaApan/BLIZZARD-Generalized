[ui] allow -applicationCSS in both e4 app and legacy workbench app

1) the primary plugin should not be jarred. e4 doesn't have one, but the legacy workbench does, org.eclipse.e4.ui.examples.legacy.workbench 2) WorkbenchApplication and the legacy app should take -applicationCSS so that you can override it on the command line. PW
