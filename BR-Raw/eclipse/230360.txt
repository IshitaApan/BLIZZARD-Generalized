[JFace] FontRegistry does not play nicely with non-UI threads

This method does: ... Display current = Display.getCurrent(); if (current == null) { Shell shell = new Shell(); } This code will _always_ fail because Shell will execute if (!display.isValidThread ()) Which is always TRUE because "current" was null.
