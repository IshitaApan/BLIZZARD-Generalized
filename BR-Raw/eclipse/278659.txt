[CSS] Border PaintListener leaks one Color instance whenever it's drawn

Created attachment 137895 Border PaintListener patch v1 Currently, a new Color instance is created every time the PaintListener is notified. I'm setting this bug as being critical because paint events are fired a bajillion times over the life cycle of an application. Multiply that by the bajillion widgets you may have that uses the 'border' attribute and you've got yourself a resource leaking "No more handles" crasher. The attached patch will fix the problem. I don't know what to do about the thrown exception though. Currently I've just chosen to ignore it, is that a problem? I did try to use the resource registry but it wasn't clear to me how I should retrieve the object. It seemed as if I had to do some magic conversion of the CSSValue into a String before I could retrieve the proper Color instance. I also didn't want to go through the trouble of registering/instantiating resources if I couldn't get one, whereas the engine would either convert it or fail, so I just used CSSEngine instead.
