Application.xmi without Window

Hi, not sure this is supposed to be working but if don't include any UI element in my model I receive an NPE. For example reduce Application.e4xmi in the contact demo to the following (no window). <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?> <application:Application xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:application="http://www.eclipse.org/ui/2008/UIModel" xmi:id="_SeXUAO8EEd6FC9cDb6iV7g" id="_SeXUAO8EEd6FC9cDb6iV7g"/> You now receive: java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.internal.PartRenderingEngine$4.run(PartRenderingEngine.java:532) As I said I'm not sure if that is supposed to be working but I would assume that e4 should also work without UI. Best regards, Lars
