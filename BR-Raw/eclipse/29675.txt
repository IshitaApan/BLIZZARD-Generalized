[Linked Resources] new path variable dialog

Build: I20030115 (from linked resource retrospective with Jeem and ChrisMc) The following comments are about the new path variable dialog (from path variable preference page, select "New"). 1. If you enter a name, it enters an error state (red X appears at top). This gives the impression that the name is wrong, when in fact the error is that the value is blank. It shouldn't be an error message until the user has typed something in the value field. It should put up a message without the error icon, and continue to disable the finish button until the user enters something in both fields. The same is true when a value is entered but the name is blank 2. The entry field labels have redundant information (the word "Variable"), and it should use the terminology "location" instead of "path" when talking about file system paths (see for example the resource info property page). The labels should simply read: Name: Location:
