Import External Project should only ask for location

0519 (related to bug 14317) The import external project should not for the project name. The project name is in the project description, so we have an answer. If someone wanted to rename a project, they could do so, but this feels like an advanced operation, not the normal operation (and there is already support to rename explicitly for the advanced case). I believe the current UI is here, because the core API did not initially support creating a project from a project description. This limitation has been addressed (bug 14317). There is a description of a corner case when importing an external project into the workspace default location. This will require additional testing. The requirement is that projects in the workspace default location are well-named (project name = simple name of project location)
