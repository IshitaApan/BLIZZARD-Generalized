[Intro] Show intro if new intro content is available

To discover newly installed functionality, it is important that we show the Welcome/intro view whenever there is new content available. Otherwise, you download new stuff and have no idea where to find the new functionality. I talked to Dejan about this and it appears that we need to do work on our side to enable this. UA would have to react and ideally highlight new content on the intro pages. I'm proposing making a change in the IDE application's WorkbenchWindowAdvisor that shows the Intro after a restart if there might be new content to show. This has to be enabled at our level because we determine very early whether to show the Intro or not, currently based on a preference. Dejan and I did this over lunch, and I'm not sure if there are corner cases that we need to watch out for so I'm asking you (Kim, specifically) to look at the patch and give feedback.
