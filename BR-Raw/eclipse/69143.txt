[ActivityMgmt] Difficult to disable activities

If activities show up in several categories, it is difficult to turn them off using the preferences page becuase all entries need to be unchecked. I suggest the following design: You already have the ability to draw the checks in the checkboxes either grey or black. The boxes that are explicitly check using the preferences page should be shown in black, all others should be shown in grey. If a user deselect an activity checkbox that is black, all matching grey checkboxes will should also be deselected (assuming there is only one black checkbox for that activity). If a user selects an unchecked activity, the checkbox should be black and all other matching activities should be checked as grey). Also, the same rule should apply for required activities; so that if a user selects an activity (A) which requires another (B), the required one (B) should be checked as grey, and if the user later deselects the main activity (A), then the required (B) activity should automatically be deselected. Finally, if all checkboxes are grey, deselecting one of them (assuming it is not required by another enabled activity) should deselect all of them. Likewise, if an activity (A) is enabled, but grey everywhere, and requires (B), which is also grey everywhere, deselecting A should deselect all occurances of B. Actually, it should recursively deselect all possible activities that are only grey.
