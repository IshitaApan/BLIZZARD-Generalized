[Properties View] Combo boxes in property sheets do not retain new values

Build: I20030813 It seems to be impossible to change the values of tracing options in a runtime workbench launch configuration. This was working last week, but doesn't work in yesterday's build. Steps: 1) Checkout org.eclipse.core.boot, org.eclipse.core.runtime, and org.apache.xerces 2) Setup target platform to include all plugins not in workspace 3) Create a runtime workbench launch configuration 4) Try to change tracing options in runtime plugin. After the cell editor closes, it reverts back to the old value.
