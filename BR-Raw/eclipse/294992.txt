[context] Simplify handling of field and method prefixes

The context injection uses field and method prefixes to identify items to be injected. I'd like to: - leave one single prefix Currently code allows contexts to override default prefixes. While that might be interesting in theory, it complicates the code as prefixes have to be passed from contexts to object links to injectors. It is unclear if there is any practical use for overriding injection prefixes, especially as focus shifted on annotation-based injections. As such, I think we only need one clearly defined prefix that is sufficiently unique, to be stored in the IContextConstants.INJECTION_PREFIX. - change prefix value from "inject_" to "inject__" (two underscores at the end) With the point above, I'd like to strengthen uniqueness of our injection prefix. "inject__" seems be easy to read and sufficiently unique. The patch also removes IContextConstants.OUTPUTS that are no longer used.
