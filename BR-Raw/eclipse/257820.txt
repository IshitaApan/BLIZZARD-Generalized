[FastView] FastView bar shows unpressed view icon after dragging active fastview to the oposite side of the screen

This happens the first time I open my RCP application, once I close it and I open again this problem doesn't happen, it seems to be related to the existence of workbench.xml and a tag about the fastview (info tag ?) I have the fastview bar in the bottom left showing some view icons, I click on one and the fast view is shown in the left side of the screen. The view icon in the fastview bar look pressed, I can't press it again. I drag the fastview to the right side, now the icon is not pressed, the view is not a fastview aymore. So I can press it again, I do it, the view is shown as fastview in the left side but in the right side the view is not closed, the title is shown but the content is empty is like a ghost view. My view is allowMultiple=fasle so it shouldn't happen. This is annoying but is not the only problem, after that other weird things happen. I have been debugging the FastViewBar.java file but without luck.
