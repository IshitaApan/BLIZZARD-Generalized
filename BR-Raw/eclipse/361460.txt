View hidden by capability filtering does not appear when capability activated

1) use File->Import Existing Projects into Workspace to import the attached projects 2) Run and note view not visible in Java Perspective (as expected) 3) Enable the "C Category Relend Perspective" capability 4) Note that the view is STILL not visible in the Java Perspective (the bug) 5) Reset the Java perspective and note the view does appear There is some code added in ModeledPageLayout by a patch for bug 355497 that hooks identifierListeners when a perspective is is created. These listeners are hooked on views that are in the perspective but are not rendered. They listen for activity enablement changes to render the view when necessary. I suspect the cause for this problem is that the code in ModeleledPageLayout is not being called when the initial layout is loaded on startup from the model. This also causes the problem when the perspective is saved with filtered views, and the restarted workbench will not show the views when the capability is enabled.
