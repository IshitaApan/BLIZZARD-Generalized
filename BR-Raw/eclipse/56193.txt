View toolbar is being repainted when the console is displaying something

I200404250800 I have a script that displays a lot of things in the console, and it appears that whenever something is being displayed in the console, the view toolbar and the tabs are being repainted. I believe this is regression since the build from I200403240800 does not blink at all or very few.
