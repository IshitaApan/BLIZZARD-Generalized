API to capture the functionality of the new Customize Perspective Dialog

The new CPD allows users to hide menu items and toolbar items discreetly. We should also provide API access this this functionality (so that various products/RCP apps can define a set of initial values to the 'override' list. The most obvious place to provide declarative API would be an extension to the existing 'perspectiveExtensions' EP; providing something similar to its current 'shortcut' extensions. This information would be used to seed the information into new workspaces only; once seeded the new mechanism would manage it through its own state persistence. Do we need a programmatic equivalent?
