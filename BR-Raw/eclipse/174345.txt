[WorkingSets] IWorkingSetElementAdapter documentation is sparse/misleading

While fixing bug 173087, I found the javadoc and schema documentation for IWorkingSetElementAdapter hard to follow. (1) The javadoc for the class does not mention that the interface is associated with the workingSets extension point. Since the intefaces is suffixed with "Adapter", I first thought I had to register the implementation using Eclipse's IAdaptable mechanism. However, there was no way to do this as there is only one implementation of IWorkingSet, owned by the platform. (2) The IWorkingSetElementAdapter class javadoc also implies this with the following statement: "may be provided by working set implementors to help manage the addition of elements to working sets". (But, we don't implement working sets?). (3) The javadoc for the "adaptElements" method does not specify what the parameters are. Once I figured out how it worked (by following the code that actually instantiates/uses the things), I found the following bug: Select a Java project, and try to add it to an existing working set. If you have breakpoint working sets, and empty group appears the the drop down menu where breakpoint working sets used to reside.
