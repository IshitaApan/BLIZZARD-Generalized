[MPE] Need API to disable key bindings in shared editor header

Based on discussion in bug 177331. Forms extends MultiPageEditorPart and provides an editor that has a shared header - the same header for all the editor pages. The header allows clients to add fields, e.g. text fields. If the current editor page is a text editor, and the focus is in one of the fields in the header, we want to turn off the key bindings that would apply to the text editor (only those). Currently we are using internal code, doing it the same way as MultiPageEditorPart. We are using: (internal,provisional) org.eclipse.ui.internal.services.INestable (deprecated) org.eclipse.ui.IKeyBindingService (deprecated) org.eclipse.ui.INestableKeyBindingService; Need a way to do this using only non-deprecated API.
