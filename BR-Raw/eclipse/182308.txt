[Contributions] [Doc] CompoundContributionItem's getContributionItems() method has no javadocs

getContributionItems() is an abstract protected method that people are supposed to subclass. Unfortunately, there are no javadocs to state what are some valid return values. Looking at the code in CompoundContributionItem itself, returning a null would cause an NPE in the fill(Menu, int) method. This should be noted.
