[Contributions] null pointer referenced is not caught when registering an action ActionBarAdvisor

If an error in ApplicationActionBarAdivosor-class occurs the application is just terminated, but does not throw an exception on console, even not in debug mode. Example: Save Action. When the save action is not created in the RCP's ActionBarAdvisor, but tried to be registered the application is just terminated. A possible solution might be: protected void register(IAction action) { 	try{ String id = action.getId(); // Assert.isNotNull(id, "Action must not have null id"); //$NON-NLS-1$ getActionBarConfigurer().registerGlobalAction(action); actions.put(id, action); 	} 	catch(NullPointerException e){ 			String message = "The to registered action element pointed to null."; //$NON-NLS-1$ 			WorkbenchPlugin.log(new Status(IStatus.ERROR, String.valueOf(WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getBundle().getBundleId()), message,e )); 		} }
