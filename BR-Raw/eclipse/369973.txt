New < > tool buttons in CTabFolder need polish

The new "go left" and "go right" tools that were added to the CTabFolder recently need several accessibility and usability improvements: 1) they need to be image tool buttons instead of the strings "<" and ">". This would make them look more polished, and it would keep screen readers from saying "less" and "greater" when the tools get focus. 2) they need to have tooltips. What are they called? What do they do? I have just been calling them "the less and greater guys". You probably want some nice tooltip strings. In addition to helping sighted people determine their function, this would allow screen readers to speak their function. (This assumes that the toolbar is being managed by ToolbarManager, because that class contains a hack for using tool item tooltip strings for the accessible names. If they are not managed by ToolbarManager, and if it is decided that ToolbarManager should not manage these toolbars, then they need). 3) they need to be disabled when pressing them would do nothing. For example: a) when there are no tabs to the left, the < should be disabled b) when there are no tabs to the right, the > should be disabled c) when all tabs are visible, both < and > should be disabled 4) for some reason, they are reversed in the tab order, i.e. if you are in an editor and type ctrl+shift+tab to traverse backwards to these buttons, you will traverse to < first and then > ...but when traversing backwards you really should go to > first and then <.
