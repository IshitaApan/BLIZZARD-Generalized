"update discovered" message misleading

When you unzip a new feature into an eclipse install and then run, you are informed that an "update" has been found, would you like to run the update manager. My first thought on seeing htis was that eclipse had gone out to the web and found that there are new versions of some of my plugins, did I want to install them (the message is almost identical to that given by acrobat, quicken, etc). Of course, I do not want to do this so I selected "no". Of course, this meant that my *new* plugins/features were not installed. The message should at least say that new things were discovered in the eclipse install. Better yet, it should simply go directly to the update manager's pending changes dialog with everything checked by default and say "we found this new stuff, please confirm its installation into eclipse". Then the user just has to click "ok". Unfortunately the will still have to restart but that is the subject of another bug report. The current model requires users to know and think too much.
