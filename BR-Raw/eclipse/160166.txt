[CommonNavigator] Actions not synched with selection

There's a problem when making actions with the common navigator framework. Strangely, it is only reproduceable when the 'Java Elements' is not used in the content provider -- I've seen it happen when trying an example only with the resources provider. To reproduce it, go to the Project Explorer, uncheck the 'Java Elements', select any resource, then press up/down to select another resource and quickly press delete (or F2, or some other action). Here what happens is that the delete will work on the resource that was previously selected and not on the new selected resource (so, the action seems to be unsynchronized with the actual selection -- made me delete a whole source folder instead of a single file -- that's why I'm marking it as critical).
