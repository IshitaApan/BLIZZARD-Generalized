Closing 1 Perspecive closes them all, until opening any back up

Eclipse Drop: December 19th Stable OS: Solaris 2.7 w/ Sun Recommended Patches HW: Sun Ultra 60 JRE: Sun 1.3.1 Motif: 2.1 CDE: 1.3 To Reproduce: Open a few Persepctives (Java, Resources, Debug, etc) Perspective -> Close Notice that the current Perspective is closed and none replaces it. Notice that there are no Perspectives listed in the toolbar pulldown Perspective -> Open -> Java(or any other) Watch them ALL come back to life including the one you closed. Consistant annoying behavior under Linux-Motif, Solaris 8 and Windows 2K
