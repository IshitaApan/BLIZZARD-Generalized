[encoding] duplicated message when error setting encoding happens

3.0 RC1 When a CoreException happens on setting the charset for a given resource, the same message is shown twice. The double message is due to the fact that the CoreException message is always equal to the status message. There is value in showing both of them. An option would be to show the message in the internal exception that caused the CoreException (CoreException.getStatus().getException()). To reproduce: 1 - disabled auto-refresh 2 - set the encoding of a file (file.txt) in a project to be something I wanted (causing a preferences file to be created in the .settings dir) 3 - opened the project preferences file (.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs) externally (using a system editor - Notepad) and changed the corresponding entry to be something else, and saved, causing the preferenecs file to be out-of-sync 4 - tried to set the encoding for file.txt to be something else. When pressing ok, an "Internal error" dialog will show up saying: "Could not save encoding settings", reason: "Could not save encoding settings".
