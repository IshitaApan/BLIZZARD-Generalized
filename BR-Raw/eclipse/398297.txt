Publish handle to e4 applications as OSGi service

Publish an OSGi-service that holds the e4 applications, see below. This way an OSGi-service centric application can find and use e.g. IEclipseContext and EModelService to manipulate the e4 application model. This will make it easier to use OSGi DS, or gemini blueprint configured components together with Eclipse e4. Referring to a discussion with Tom Schindl(http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/448951/): "You can convince me that we publish something like EApplicationService giving you access to running application instances anything else does not make sense. interface EApplicationsService { // Published as OSGI-service! public List<ApplicationInstance> getApplications(); public ApplicationInstance getApplication(String id); } interface ApplicationInstance { public String getId(); // UUID of the application public IEclipseContext getContext(); } ...
