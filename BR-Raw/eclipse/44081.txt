[Navigator] Resource Navigator has sticky duplicate item after rename

I20030930 Resource Navigator has sticky duplicate item after rename Steps: - create new workspace - in the Resource Navigator, create new simple project "prj" - create folder "folder" inside "prj" - create file "file.txt" inside "folder" - in the Resource Navigator, select file "file.txt" - choose menu File > Rename (or press F2) and change the name to "fool.txt" -> In "folder", I have two items "fool.txt" which both represent the same file. When I delete one of the tree items, the file is deleted from the filesystem. One of the tree items "fool.txt" inside "folder" stays there and can't be removed, not even by a refresh. It only goes away when I rename "folder" or restart eclipse. Note: the same problem seems to exist for *all* files and folders on the second level ("thing" inside a folder inside a project) Note2: this might be related to bug 44066.
