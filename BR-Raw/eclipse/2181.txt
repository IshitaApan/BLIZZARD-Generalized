Browse directories dialog is empty (1GEA8DN)

Open the new project wizard Select Project Press the next button Enter a project name Uncheck use default directory Press browse There is a beep and the directory dialog is empty The dialog should show the directory that most closely maps to what you have entered. NOTES: RG (5/25/01 8:51:17 AM)	 	On Windows we always seem to open on "My Computer" SA (5/25/2001 10:01:43 AM) 	This has been reported before but as a reminder... the DirectoryDialog which 	is being used to select a directory does not accept "/" as part of the initial 	directory. It must be "\" on Windows. 	It would be nice if DirectoryDialog did this parsing for us. Also, we should 	use toOSString() on IPath so that we get the correct separator for the platform. EJP (6/25/01 1:59:55 PM) 	Re-tested it. In my machine it shows the dev eclipse working directory. EJP (7/11/01 1:39:31 PM) 	The method WizardNewProjectCreationPage::handleLocationBrowseButtonPressed() 	should be fixed to use IPath::toOSString().
