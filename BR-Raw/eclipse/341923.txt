Improve CheckedTreeSelectionDialog : Add the possibility to choose the style of the TreeViewer

Currently, when we use the dialog CheckedTreeSelectionDialog, we can' t specify the style of the TreeViewer. The TreeViewer have always the style SWT.BORDER. In my case, I need to change this style ( SWT.BORDER | SWT.FULL_SELECTION). At the beginning, I wanted to override the method createTreeViewer, but it's not possible, because some field are not accessible because they are in private. I propose to you to add a new constructor, with a new parameter int style. This style will be used to instantiate the TreeViewer.
