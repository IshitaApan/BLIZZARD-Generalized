[Markers] Improve 'No Quick Fix' dialog from new Marker view

20071101-0010 - In the new markers view select a problem marker with no quick fix, for example a syntax error in a Java file - Open the context menu and invoke 'Quick Fix' This opens a warning dialog that is not so helpful. See screenshot. a. Message says: No fixes found (Time of error: ...). This is a warning, not an error. I don't see the advantage of knowing the time of error/warning. b. 'Reason: Check the details' is strange. The reason doesn't seem to be necessary. It doesn't say more. c. The dialog title should be the same as the name of the action the user just called: 'Quick Fix' It should use title capitalization, see Guideline 1.5 http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Guidelines/Contents.html
