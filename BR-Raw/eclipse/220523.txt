[StatusHandling] Improve information on error dialog

Created attachment 90838 screenshot I20080226-1155 - create an class A - search for declarations of A - delete A - go to the search view and press 'Search again' (for A) You get an error dialog. See attachment a.) The first line in bold says 'Error'. I think the word 'Error' should be avoided, it's rather a 'problem'. I also think that this is already clear from the image and the dialog title. b.) The information 'Java Search (Time of error: Not available)' is not so useful. I suggest, if there is no time of error, then better leave this away. Maybe 'Java Search' could also be embedded in a message: 'Java Search' reported a problem: Element 'A' does not exist. c.) Details shows exactly the same as written in the declaration. I suggest to no offer details, if there are no details
