WBWRenderer has dead code

A layout is set on line 292... wbwShell.setLayout(new FillLayout()); ...then a layout is set again on line 305... if (element instanceof MWindow) { TrimmedPartLayout tl = new TrimmedPartLayout(wbwShell); wbwShell.setLayout(tl); } else { wbwShell.setLayout(new FillLayout()); } ...but the instanceof check was already done in the beginning. The TPL should just have been set on line 292 to begin with.
