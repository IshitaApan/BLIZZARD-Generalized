[Wizards] "Import Existing Project" loops forever with cyclic symbolic links

We have some existing C/C++ code from an embedded Linux kernel, that uses a cyclic symbolic link in its header file structure: kernel/include/h --> ../include When trying to import an existing Eclipse project from any folder above that construct, the Import Wizard loops forever trying to locate all .project files. This is a major problem, because due to this bug, projects for that particular Linux Kernel can not be shared in a team. This is limiting the functionality of Eclipse. We have no workaround for this issue, and we cannot get rid of that cyclic link in the Kernel since it would not compile anymore if we did. Cyclic symbolic links have been a problem for long, and we've been using a locally applied patch in our version of Eclipse for 3.2x. We're extremely happy that most issues around Refresh have been fixed for Eclipse 3.3M7 through bug #105554, so we do not need that patch any more. But unfortunately, it turns out that the import wizard in WizardProjectsImportPage, the code just uses java.io.File and not the Eclipse LocalFileSystem or Resource system, so that fix does not apply. We think that the bug can be fixed easily, and we'd hope our patch gets accepted for Eclipse 3.3 (not sure if there is still any maintenance done for 3.2x?)
