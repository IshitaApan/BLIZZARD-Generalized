[Undo] - Resource undo only works when Navigator is active

Build: I20061031-0656 Undo of resource changes only works when the Navigator view has focus. This feels really subtle and I'm wondering if it will be a barrier to people discovering and using it. For example, if I create a new file, focus is immediately given to the editor so you don't even know the undo option is there unless you click back into the navigator. Likewise if a user happens to switch to the Outline or some other view, I could see them getting frustrated that undo stops working. I don't really know the right answer here - I realize separate parts can have different undo stacks. Maybe if the new active part has no undo stack or its stack is empty, you should keep the previous part's undo stack active? I don't know much about the implementation details so I'm a bit fuzzy, but it feels wrong as a user that I always have to click back into the Navigator to get undo to work...
