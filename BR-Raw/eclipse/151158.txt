[KeyBindings][MPE] MultiPageEditorPart sends key events to editor without focus

I have an Eclipse plugin that contains a MultiPageEditor with 2 pages. The first page is a TextEditor used for editing a type of source code. The second page, an Editor Part, is a graphical representation of the source code. I've run across an issue when the active editor page is the second page. When the second page's editor is active/focused, pressing CTRL-A will select all of the text on the first page's editor (even though it is not active). Then, pressing DEL while on the second page's edtior will delete all of the text on the first page's editor. Other key strokes that get "forwarded" to the first page are CTRL-X, CTRL-V, and CTRL-C. This key event forwarding should not happen, when an editor is not selected, it should not be receiving any key events from the selected editor. If this is indeed a bug, is there a known workaround?
