[Preferences] (HEAD) Preference pages not scrollable (accessible) via keyboard

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #245159 +++ Build ID: I20080207-1530 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Set Windows OS to high contrast mode with extra large font (ie. in Control Panel > Accessibility Options, click Settings button and select "High Contrast Black (extra large)" ) 2. In Eclipse, select Windows > Preferences... to open up Preferences dialog 3. Select "Java" node to show the Java preference page (or any longer preference page) 4. Notice vertical and horizontal scrollbars (Display has resolution 1024x768) 5. Tab to traverse different controls in preference page. Result: When reaching controls that are not seen initially, the scrolled composite does not scroll to make that control visible. Expected: Scrolled composite in preference page should be scrolled to show the control the user is focusing on. More information: I noticed there is API introduced in Eclipse 3.4 for ScrolledComposite that makes the controls visible as a user traverses via keyboard: public void setShowFocusedControl(boolean show) Could the ScrolledComposite used in the PreferenceDialog take advantage of that new API?
