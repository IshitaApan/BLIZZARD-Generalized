UI message classes should sub-class OSGi NLS class

When we converted some of the UI message classes to the new format, we used the tool and made them subclasses of the NLS class in the Runtime project. We have since deprecated this class and moved it to the OSGi project. We need to change the super-class of the following classes to be the OSGi NLS class: - ActivityMessages - IntroMessages - KeyAssistMessages Tod, we can do this when we convert the WorkbenchMessages class to the new format. (note the tools has since been updated to make the super-class the OSGi class)
