Example project for an Eclipse 4 Editor

Created attachment 156443 Adding an editor Surprisingly, we don't have examples of editors in the E4 demos. I'd like to make a simple one to: - progress on the E4 extensibility (org.eclipse.ui.editors replacement); - flash out editor-specific problems, such as determining part ID; - to have one as an example. The code in the attachment adds a menu item to the photo demo "File" -> "Open Note" that opens (or creates) a file with ".txt" extension and the file name of the selected picture. This meant to be something like a text note for the picture. Obvious issues: - Editor IDs: can't use the same ID or render goes crazy. - Need an editor manager to find existing editor - Discovering functionality: how would a person guess that "Composite" needs to be injected to get a parent composite; "MUILabel" to change label; "MDirtyable" to participate in dirty parts lifecicle, etc. - MInput - if it works with URIs, do we want it to get/return Strings?
