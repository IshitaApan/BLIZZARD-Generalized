System Info does not show/list Features

Per the last go around: "Please file another PR if support for additional diagnostics is required." The System Info content may need another pass. Based on the discussion in (http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19301) we may need to consider some restructure to the order of the content as well as adding more information about the active features. Points: 1. Given the default of 10, the probability that products will push this number much higher (such as 100+ to ensure they have a full log), and the update manager UI change to show them in the reverse order so that the most recent is at the top: >System Info may want to move the configuration change log to after the error log and reverse the order to be consistent with the UI rendering of the same information. 2.Product service may require both a granular and conceptual view of what is installed. Plugin details are granular. Features are conceptual. Visibility to the active features, with version info, is available in both the About features dialog and the Update Manager perspective. >This information must be in the system info, near/before the plug-in details (or indented plugins under a feature (like fragments are shown for a plugin) would work too). 3.Nit. The spaced line after each indented fragment for a plug-in implies that there is a grouping of the plugins. This is false as the fragment existence triggers the blank link - but the implication drives confusion when trying to visually parse the content. > If plug-ins were listed by feature - then blanks/separator's before the feature would work. If not, then maybe the blank after a fragment should be removed as the indentation would be enough and reduce the visual confusion. 4.Trying to determine if more detail about features/plugins impacted by a configuration change is available. If it is, this would be requested as part of the system info content.
