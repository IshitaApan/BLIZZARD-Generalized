[Progress] PROPERTY_IN_DIALOG not set to false when preference run in background is set

1) check the preference Workbench>"Run user actions in background where possible" 2) perform a CVS compare ->the resulting dialog pops-up immediatly, it isn't kept until I ask for it. I would have expected the same behaviour as if having pressed "Run in Background", i.e., the results are kept. The problem is that the ProgressManager.PROPERTY_IN_DIALOG property is only set when the progress dialog is dismissed. This means it isn't set when the user runs with the preference set. How about this: * when the progress dialog opens the property is set * when the user dismisses the dialog by pressing Run in background then the property is reset/removed * clients that want to know whether the operation is run in the background only check for the existance of the property
