[Field Assist] - should proposal popup ever open if empty?

See also bug #144225. If there are no proposals in the proposal list, should the content proposal popup open at all? In 3.2, we don't detect the "empty proposal" case until the popup is opening. It would be nicer to determine this before hand and never open the popup. This makes the "auto-complete" scenario work much nicer.
