Dynamic menu contribution call back similar to Eclipse 3 org.ui.menus dynamic ContributionItem

--- Following up to http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/373495/ In order to realize a fully dynamic menu within e4, the dynamic menu populator is missing. The behaviour should be similar to the dynamic menu as described for the Eclipse 3.x extension point org.eclipse.ui.menus - http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2Forg_eclipse_ui_menus.html #dynamic element. To realize this, a call back on opening a MMenu Element would be required, in which it is possible to dynamically modify the Menu. The behaviour should NOT be to modify the entire application model on changes, but lazily at the request of opening the specific sub-menu. So for example, a sub-element to an MMenu entry could be DynamicItem with a reference to a class where @Execute public void execute(MMenu element) would allow to dynamically modify the Menu. This element has to be called every time the resp. menu is opened (behaviour equivalent to Eclipse 3 when isDynamic() returned true)!
