Replace context name with computable debug string

Contexts currently are required to have a name, but this string is only used for debugging purposes. We should instead store this "debug string" in the context itself, allowing clients to use a computed value to add additional debug information. We can make this name optional by supplying a default value, which simplifies life for clients that don't care about the name (much as toString() is optional and a default is provided for those who don't care to implement it).
