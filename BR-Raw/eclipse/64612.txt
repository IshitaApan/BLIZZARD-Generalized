[Presentations] Tabs flash/flicker during long running operation that modifies hidden view

3.0M9 To reproduce, turn on Window > Preferences > Team > CVS > Console > Show CVS output in the Console View. Open a console view but hide it behind another view (i.e., open another view on top of it, for example I have Search, Problems, and Site Explorer in the same stack with Console). In the Package Explorer, right click on a java file that has a non-trivial amount of history (I used org.eclipse.ui.texteditor.FindReplaceDialog.java), and select Team > Show Annotations. On Windows XP, all the tabs that are in the same folder as the hidden Console view will flicker continuously until the annotation operation is complete. I think CVS is writing to its console, causing the Console view tab to be bolded over and over again becase it's hidden, but the part presentation (r3 default) is not smart enough to know it's already bolded and doesn't have to redraw or relayout the tab folder.
