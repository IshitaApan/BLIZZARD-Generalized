[DataBinding] ListBinding does not update from model to target in some cases

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #244098 +++ When working with observable lists, calling binding.updateModelToTarget(); fails to update the target correctly in some cases. The reason seems to be that the model observable list has not refreshed it's content from the wrapped bean/pojo. See attached code samples for details. Case #1 * BeansObservables used for target and model * Target-to-Model policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_UPDATE * Model-to-Target policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_ON_REQUEST Case #2 * PojoObservables used for target and model * Target-to-Model policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_UPDATE * Model-to-Target policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_ON_REQUEST Case #3 * PojoObservables used for target and model * Target-to-Model policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_UPDATE * Model-to-Target policy: UpdateListStrategy.POLICY_UPDATE This is reproducible in 3.4 and 3.5. (In 3.4 the snippets are also affected by Bug 236605 )
