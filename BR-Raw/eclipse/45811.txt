[Dialogs] Problematic behavior of WorkbenchPreferenceDialog.setShellSize()

I20031023 MacOS X 10.3 - in Panther open Window > Preferences > Ant > Editor Observe: all hell breaks loose... I had to restart my machine and lost work! Two problems here: - a width of 12902 and a height of 16909 is passed to WorkbenchPreferenceDialog.setShellSize() (why this is the case needs further investigation) - however, JavaDoc of setShellSize states: "Changes the shell size to the given size, ensuring that it is no larger than the display bounds" the implementation is: 	private void setShellSize(int width, int height) { 		getShell().setSize(width, height); 		constrainShellSize(); 	} I think it doesn't make much sense to first set the Shell's size to a bogus value and then constrain its size to something sensible.
