Help of Shell is overriden by Eclipse when Workbench starts

Our product (IBM Installation Manager) has one perspective with a stand-alone view. In the ViewPart.setFocus(), we set the help id by using: public void setFocus() { PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getHelpSystem().setHelp(this.getSite().getShell(), getHelpRef()); //.... } But ViewPart.setFocus() is called in 'page.setPerspective(perspective)' in WorkbenchWindow.setup(): public void setup() { //... page.setPerspective(perspective); //... workbench.getHelpSystem().setHelp(getShell(), IWorkbenchHelpContextIds.WORKBENCH_WINDOW); //... } And later one, the help id for our product shell was overriden by workbench.getHelpSystem().setHelp(getShell(), IWorkbenchHelpContextIds.WORKBENCH_WINDOW); as you can see from WorkbenchWindow.setup(). This is a regression from Eclipse 4.2.1 adoption.
