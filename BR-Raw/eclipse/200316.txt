[CommonNavigator] Can not contribute property page to classpath container in project explorer

Created attachment 76278 proposed fix I20070815-1600 I'm contributing a property page to classpath containers (see bug 191753 for the reason). This works fine in the Package Explorer. But the Project Explorer does not show the 'Properties' action for classpath container entries. Reason is that this action is only contributed to IResources. As far as I understand the common navigator can show any kind of element, so it should also be possible to contribute a property page to any kind of element, at least any adaptable. The attached patch fixes the issue.
