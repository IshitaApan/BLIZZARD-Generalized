[Progress] Finished Tasks Still Show In Progress View

Needs to be fixed in 3.6 as well. +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #287761 +++ Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Launch Eclipse with provided plugin 2. Click Eclipse icon in toolbar 3. Once progress icon shows in the status bar click it to open the progress view 4. Wait for job to run and finish, do not clear finished job from the view 5. Close progress view 6. Go to Window -> Show View -> Progress Problem: Notice task that appears to be running in the progress view and never finishes. More information: From debugging the progress view code it appears that this job and its task gets added to the FinishedJobs object when it finishes. When you close the view and open it again while the new job is running the job is placed back in the view, but the associated task is also placed back in the view. Before the task was associated with the job and now it seems to be separated out and appears to be running, even though it is not. This all appears to take place in ProgressViewContentProvider.getElements.
