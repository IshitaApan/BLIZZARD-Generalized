Unable to restart after upgrade

I upgraded from I20110114 to I20110225. After the upgrading, the workbench will not start. There are a large number of NPE's in the log. I will attach the whole log, but here are some example: Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.contains(Workbench.java:1870) 	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.defineBindingTable(Workbench.java:1852) java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.setReference(Workbench.java:1681) 	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.access$19(Workbench.java:1677)
