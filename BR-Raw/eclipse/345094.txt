[Compatibility] ShowViewMenu contribution item doesn't show all entries

I have a problem in an RCP application running on the Compatibility layer with the ShowViewMenu contribution item (created in ApplicationActionBarAdvisor via ContributionItemFactory.VIEWS_SHORTLIST). It is added directly to the window menu because there are just two views to show (Console and Properties). Normally the window menu should look like this: - Console - Properties - Separator - Other - Preferences (this is a normal action) When running on Eclipse 4.1, it only shows the first entry (Console) and nothing else, not even the Preferences action. When removing the contribution item, the Preferences action is visible as it should be. When putting the contribution item after the Preferences action, both Preferences and Console are visible, but still not the others. Is this related to or caused by Bug 316470?
