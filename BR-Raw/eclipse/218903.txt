[Viewers] support extensibility of the refresh job in FilteredTree

As per the previous conversations on bug 74795 and bug 128233, the current FilteredTree refresh policy does not scale well to Mylyn's Task List. In order to address this we created an AdaptiveRefreshPolicy that delays refresh in proportion to the length of the filter text that has been entered. While we are able to override FilteredTree.textChanged(), we cannot set the refresh job so we have had to do this reflectively on construction on our subtype of FilteredTree. In order to get rid of the reflection hack we need just a bit more extensibility, from: 	private void createRefreshJob() { ... } 	 To: 	protected Job createRefreshJob(PatternFilter patternFilter) { ... } 	 Clients could then override the refresh job to create a custom refresh job with their additional semantics. While this could make better sense from the point of view of consistent extensibility, since textChanged(..) is already protected, all that we need for the Mylyn case is to access the refreshJob. So for us the just the addition of the following getter is sufficient: 	protected Job getRefreshJob() { 		return refreshJob; 	}s
