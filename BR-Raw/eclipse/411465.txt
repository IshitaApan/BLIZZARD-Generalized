EditorPart#isSaveOnCloseNeeded() not called when closing Editor Part

(I was advised by PW in Bug #405562 to open a new bug report, so here it is.) The behaviour is exactly as that described in Bug #3772992, this time caused by a regression introduced (I think) by the fix for Bug #405562. A 3.8 based RCP app is running in E4 RC4. Build id: I20130605-2000 with the "compatibility" layer. I have Editor parts that sub-class EditorPart. I over-ride isSaveOnCloseNeeded() to return false so that the "<resource> has been modified. Save changes?" dialog is *not* shown by the workbench if the editor is dirty and the user manually closes the editor part. However, isSaveOnCloseNeeded() is not called and the dialog is shown. This works when using Ctrl+W but not when clicking on the 'X'.
