[Dialogs] [dialogs] Strange selection behaviour in FilteredItemsSelectionDialog

Build ID: I20070323-1616 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Open a FilteredItemsSelectionDialog 2. Make sure that some entries are in the history and 'fillContentProvider' takes some time to return (e.g. by Thread.sleep(5000)) 3. Type into the filter such that at least one, but not all of the history items match and 'fillContentProvider' is called. 4. Select one of the history items. Notice that - it seems that the list containing the element is filtered, but the UI is not updated. - Selecting any history item will either show the selection on an empty line if there are not enough results after filtereing or - The label of the selected item changes on click as if this very entry is updated from the content (which is already filtered) More information: I hope the scenario is more or less clear. Filtering on the history is done on the elements but not reflected in the UI. I would expect that the history is immediately filtered and the UI is updated. On return of 'fillContentProvider' these results become visible in the UI and any selection done in between is kept stable. The call to 'fillContentProvider' has to handle the fact that this operation can be really long-running (several seconds).
