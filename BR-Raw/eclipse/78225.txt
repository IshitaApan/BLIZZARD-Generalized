[Preferences] Clarify spec w.r.t. threads and change notification

There is no mention of threads in the API for change notification. (surfaced while investigating bug 77280) The problem is that changes to preference have always assumed to have been done in the UI thread. Consider the following use cases: - UI has preference key DOCK_PERSPECTIVE_BAR which is defined as API in IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants - UI has a listener which reacts to changes in this preference value and makes changes to all of the workbench's windows - this MUST occur in the UI thread (see bug 77241) - but since the preference key is API, anyone can make changes to the value - this includes jobs in non-UI threads We need to clarify the spec w.r.t. threads. Something like: if you write a preference change listener (PCL) and you are reacting by doing actions which require you to be in the UI thread, then you need to asyncExec. After discussions, we are not sure whether putting the Runtime preference change notification in the background is a good idea. Either way, we will still have the same problems (with listeners) if anyone else changes API UI-dependant preferences in a non-UI thread.
