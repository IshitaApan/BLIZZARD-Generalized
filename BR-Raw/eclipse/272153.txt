[Wizards] Accessibility: Reading of back/next buttons by Screenreader

When using the ScreenReader JAWS V8, back buttons are read as “less back button” and next buttons are read as “next greater button” This is because of the <> signs on the buttons. As far as we know, the </> signs come from the JFace/SWT classes, and other texts should be underlayed to this buttons.
