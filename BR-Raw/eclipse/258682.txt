[Browser] Add Google Chrome to the default list of browsers

Build ID: I20081030-1917 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Windows: Install Google Chrome (which is no longer in beta) 2. Install Eclipse 3. Look at Eclipse's list of browsers (Preferences, General > Web Browsers) Actual results: Google Chrome is not in the list Expected result: Google Chrome should be in the list One thing that might make this slightly trickier to implement than some other browsers is that it appears that Chrome is not installed into a standard location. For example, on my Windows Vista machine, Chrome was installed here: C:\Users\mmoreart\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe So because of that, adding it may take a little more work than simply adding an "org.eclipse.ui.browser.browsers" extension point with a <location> tag.
