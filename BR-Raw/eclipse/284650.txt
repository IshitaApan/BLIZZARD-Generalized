[CommonNavigator] Misleading JavaDoc of the INavigatorContentService

Build ID: 20090619-0625 Steps To Reproduce: It is stated: "Clients should create instances of the this class using the factory ({@link NavigatorContentServiceFactory}).", which is truth for creation of a new instance only. If the instance of INavigatorContentService is required to configure the existing CNF instance, it should be obtained from the Navigator instead. More information: Here is a chat transcript with Francis Upton: [4:54:09 PM] Simon Zambrovski: NavigatorContentServiceFactory <- this guy is not intended to be used by clients in order to get access to the INavigatorContentService, right? So INavigatorContentService service = new NavigatorContentServiceFactory().createContentService("my.view.id"); is not working, but I should find the view (via IWorkbenchPage.findView()), cast it to the CommonNavigator and finally retrieve the NavigatorContentService from it by calling CommonNavigator.getNavigatorContentService() [4:56:38 PM] Francis Upton: yes [4:56:55 PM] Simon Zambrovski: ok. i'll add this to the wiki, because once you find the INavigatorContentService, its JavaDoc says - use the factory to get an instance of it.... [4:58:39 PM] Francis Upton: the javadoc comments are misleading, it refers to the use of it in a standalone manner which is possible, but not what you want. You want the one assicated with the CN. [4:59:13 PM] Francis Upton: can you file a bug about this? You can copy this transcript into the bug report, and that way I can clean up the doc.
