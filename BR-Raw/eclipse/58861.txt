[Javadoc] Activities API doc problems

IActivity The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime plugin activation and deactivation, which can cause dynamic changes to the extension registry. isDefined give no idea what defined means removeActivityListener unregisters is not a word IActivityActivityBinding really bad name but it may be too late to change it not clear what child and parent mean - does it mean dependand and prerequisite? IActivityManager also has trouble with the worl unregister IActivityPattern binding has no context - likely needs a @see to point at the spot where it is used ICategory asserts usefulness but is not used in the workbench anywhere - we should make that clear getCategoryActivityBindings should @see ICategoryActivityBinding
