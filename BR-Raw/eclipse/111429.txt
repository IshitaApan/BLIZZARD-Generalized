[Markers] Multi-select quickfix does not batch confirmation and stops on first failure

Unfortunately the bug 23889 was not completely fixed. There are some flaws left: - If a line contains multiple warnings with the same quick-fix, like missing JavaDoc tags the fix you will get a warning "There are no quick fixes available for the selected marker" and the fixes are aborted. - If several warnings of the same type are selected (like the missing JavaDoc tags) every fix needed requires the user to select between alternatives instead of applying the same alternative to all fixes. Using the same fix for all selected issues can of course only be applied if no more than one type of issue is selected. If two different issues in the task list are selected then each will require it's own action.
