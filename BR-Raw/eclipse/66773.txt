Hangs every time I add a new feature/site

Did this 3 times with 0611 00:10 and once with 0611 12:38. I use the Update Manager Product Config dialog to add a site. Pointing at a site where I've unzipped Eclipse Examples (and added a .eclipseextension file - see Bug 66758). Tried an alt site as well. Dialog prompts for a restart yes/no or apply. Hangs after yes.
