[EditorMgmt] Specifying an icon using platform:/plugin stopped working

In EMF we use registrations like this in the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.editor plugin: <extension point = "org.eclipse.ui.editors"> <editor id = "org.eclipse.emf.ecore.presentation.ReflectiveEditorID" name = "%_UI_ReflectiveEcoreEditor_label" icon = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.emf.edit/icons/full/obj16/ModelFile.gif" extensions = "xmi" class = "org.eclipse.emf.ecore.presentation.EcoreEditor" contributorClass="org.eclipse.emf.ecore.presentation.EcoreActionBarContributor$R eflective" > </editor> </extension> to reuse icons from another plugin, so that we don't have to make countless copies of them. This has stopped working recently. In fact, it's stopped working so badly that you can't even open the editor anymore, as reported in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=61450 This problem is critical, at least until 61450 is fixed, since the editors won't come up at all and the error message provides not a clue about the reason why.
