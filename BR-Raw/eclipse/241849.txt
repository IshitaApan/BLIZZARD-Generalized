[Markers] Need a property tester to test the marker type of a MarkerEntry

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: There is no property tester defined in org.eclipse.ui.ide for testing the marker type of a MarkerEntry in a marker view. Such a tester would be very useful for clients who are trying to add popup menu items to a marker view. I could define a property tester in my own plug-in for testing the marker type, but then I run in to plug-in activation issues. It would be better for the tester to be defined in a lower-level plug-in. More information: In 3.4, the marker views no longer support using object contributions to add to the popup menu. This means that existing object contributions need to be migrated to the command/handler infrastructure. However, with object contributions, it was possible to control visibility and enablement using the filters defined in IMarkerActionFilter. The command/handler infrastructure uses property testers to accomplish this sort of filtering instead; it would be nice for the platform to define property testers equivalent to these filters to make migration easier.
