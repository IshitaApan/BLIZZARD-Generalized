[PropertiesView] PropertySheetPage Help Integration Does Not Work In a Wizard

I've created a wizard page that uses a PropertySheetPage. If the PSP has focus and I press F1 to open help, a NPE occurs. The NPE occurs in the PropertySheetPage class on line 233 which is this: getSite().getWorkbenchWindow().getWorkbench().getHelpSystem().displayHelp(HELP_CONTEXT_PROPERTY_SHEET_PAGE); getSite() returns null because the PSP is not in a view. From what I can tell, getSite() is only being called to get the help system, which can be done in another way. If the help system was acquired in a different way that didn't involve getting the site I think this would work. Here's an example I tried which works: PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getHelpSystem().displayHelp(HELP_CONTEXT_PROPERTY_SHEET_PAGE); So, I think only a minor change in the eclipse UI is required to resolve the issue I have. I will attach a patch that contains this fix.
