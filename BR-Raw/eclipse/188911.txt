[Contributions] [Doc] IContributionItem.dispose() says it should not be called by clients

3.3 RC1. IContributionItem.dispose() says it should not be called by clients but this happens all over the place in the SDK e.g. to dispose menu managers which are also an IContributionItem. I guess this restriction should be removed.
