[ActivityMgmt] Activities with expressions can't be correctly enabled when they have a defaultEnabled extension point entry

Build ID: I20080207-1530 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create an activity with an enabledWhen expression, which is by default disabled. 2. Cerate a defaultEnabled entry for this activity. 3. Try to enable the activity via enabling the belonging expression. 4. --> Error: The activity manager looks in the list of already enabled activities and finds the (actually disabled!) activity in there, so it doesn't updates it and set the activities enabled state to "enabled". More information: Whilst this is super-secure (no enablement for anyone), it can lead to real confusion if there is some (old and forgotten, 3rd party plugin, etc.) defaultEnablement entry which targets via an activityPatternBinding to the disabled activity with an enabledWhen Expression. It is really unlikely that someone does this intentionally (using defaultEnablement and enabledWhen expressions together makes no sense), but the risk that this happens accidently isn't low, so this should be really not taken as a low priority bug.
