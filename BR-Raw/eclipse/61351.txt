[RCP] [Themes] CURRENT_THEME_ID pref is always written

build I20040506-0200 - run the browser example - exit - there's a prefs file in the metadata area with: #Thu May 06 23:29:06 EDT 2004 eclipse.preferences.version=1 CURRENT_THEME_ID=org.eclipse.ui.defaultTheme It looks like, at least for a very simple RCP app, this is the only pref being written. It would be nice if no prefs were explicitly set unless needed (setting defaults does not cause a write). Some RCP apps may not want a workspace folder. This is possible to achieve with the runtime, as long as no higher layers force it.
