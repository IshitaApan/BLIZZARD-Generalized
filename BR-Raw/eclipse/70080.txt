[RCP] Reset Perspective does not work if no perspective toolbar shown (RCP)

In my small Rich Client Platformt (RCP) app I support only one perspective and so do not show the perspective toolbar, but would like to allow the user to reset the perspective if they stuff it up by closing views etc. When no perspective toolbar is shown the standard reset perspective action does nothing. The method busyResetPerspective() in org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchPage unnecessarily exits if window.findPerspectiveShortcut(oldPersp.getDesc(), this) returns null.
