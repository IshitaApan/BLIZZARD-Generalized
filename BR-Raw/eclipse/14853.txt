[Perspective] Opening perspective does not activate any view

When using the keyboard to switch between perspectives, a view from the newly opened perspective does not get activated. To recreate this problem: - Create an EJB project in a new EAR. This will open the j2ee perspective - Alt, W[indow], O[pen perspective], enter (opens the data perspective.) - Ctrl+F7 brings up a popup which can be used to select the active view. Keep pressing F7 while holding control, until "Data definition" is active. - Alt, W, O, J[2ee perspective], enter (brings the j2ee perspective back to the front) - Press the "properties" key (next to right control) to bring up the context menu. Notice that the context menu which is shown is the one for the data definitions view, which is not a view which is currently visible. The keyboard must be used to recreate this defect because using the mouse will activate the correct view before bringing up the context menu.
