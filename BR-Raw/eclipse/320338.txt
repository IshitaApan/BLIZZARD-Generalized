SplitDropAgent should not use client area for preview rectangle

Created attachment 174688 screenshot The preview rectangle for dragging parts is inconsistent and IHMO wrong for view stacks (because the dragged view will not be placed inside of the drop target). See screenshot. It seems there is code in SplitDropAgent.getRectangle(...) that was meant to fetch the CTabFolder for computing the rectangle, but this code fails because there is another Composite between the drop part's widget and the CTabFolder. A fix would be to add another "if" to check the parent's parent, or to always check for the parent's parent (if the intermediate Composite always exists). if (ctrl.getParent() instanceof CTabFolder) ctrl = ctrl.getParent(); else if (ctrl.getParent().getParent() instanceof CTabFolder) ctrl = ctrl.getParent().getParent();
