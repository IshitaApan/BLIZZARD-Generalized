Fast views too slow when going away (1GE8IHM)

Fast views open quickly but have a scroll effect on closing. The effect is neat the first time you see it but quickly becomes a pain especially if the fast view is expanded across the workbech (ex. tasklist > 1sec.) NOTES: 	RG (5/24/2001 4:58:22 PM) 	The effect looks bad on Linux. 	It leaves a series of edges which then disappear one at a time.
