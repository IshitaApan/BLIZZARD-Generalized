[Workbench] Project copy doesn't validate location and uses invalid location as default

Build: I2006114 1) Create a new project whose location is outside the workspace (say c:\temp\p1). 2) Select the project in the Navigator, and Hit Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. 3) The project copy dialog opens. Accept the default and hit Ok. -> An error occurs because the location overlaps the location of the project being copied. There are two problems here: a) If the project is not in the default location, it should populate the dialog with a new location that is different from the original location (such as c:\temp\Copy of P1). I.e., it should provide reasonable defaults that don't cause the copy to fail. b) The location provided in the dialog should be validated using IWorkspace#validateProjectLocation. The Ok button should be greyed out until a valid location is supplied.
