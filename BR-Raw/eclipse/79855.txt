[IDE] isCompatibleVersion method in IDEApplication appears wrong...

discovered this when I was reading the source code of 3.0.1 for writing a RCP application... :) in detection of compatible java vm version, "isCompatibleVersion" method in IDEApplication class shows: // make sure the running vm's major is >= the requirement if (!tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) 	return true; int major = Integer.parseInt(tokenizer.nextToken()); if (major != MIN_JVM_VERSION_MAJOR) 	return major > MIN_JVM_VERSION_MINOR; // <-- PROBLEM??? so, the above code reads, "if major version# is different, major version must be greater than required minor version". this does not make sense... perhaps, it should be: return major > MIN_JVM_VERSION_MAJOR; I suppose this bug won't surface until java's major version reaches "2"... thanks, David Wada saint_uv@yahoo.com
