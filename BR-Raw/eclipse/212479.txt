[Browser] URL selection in Eclipse browser is not possible for documents or forms

Attempting to select a URL from the URL navigation drop down list is not possible if the current loaded page is a *.doc, *.frm, or *.xfdl file. As soon as the list is selected the currently loaded form reloads. Steps: 1. Open an html file in eclipse. 2. Once the browser is loaded, type in the location of a *.doc or *.frm file (eg. D:\Jonathan's Docs\test.doc or D:\Jonathan's Docs\test.frm) and press enter. 3. In the case of a document, select [Open] on the pop dialog to open. 4. The document or form will now be loaded in the browser. 5. Now attempt to select the drop down arrow of the URL navigation control to select a previously loaded page. 6. Note that as soon as you click on the drop down, the current document reloads leaving you no chance to make a selection.
