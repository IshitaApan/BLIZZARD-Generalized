[Properties View] DCR: PageBookView should support shared pages

There are valid cases where two+ IEditorParts would like to use the same shared page as their contributed page to the Properties View, and in our case, the GEF palette. For the properties view, returning a custom propertysheet page means that your Table widget is unique to the editor. So, if the user resizes the columns in instance 1, and then switches to instance 2 of the same editor type, the columns have to be resized again. For the GEF palette, shared behavior would be the expansion of drawers and other UI state which has no reason to be instance based. We need this behavior for GEF 3.0, so if it isn't implemented, we will have to implement it. But, if we do it, propertysheet clients would not benefit. I'd be happy to commit the fix.
