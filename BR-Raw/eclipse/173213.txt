[Commands] Show View cannot be executed from the Command Composer

The command composer has an execute function to allow users to check out their commands. While some command won't work from that situation, Show View used to until I changed from workbench.getActiveWorkbenchWindow() to HandlerUtil.getActiveWorkbenchWindow(event). I suspect that being in a dialog is not providing the ACTIVE_WORKBENCH_WINDOW_NAME variable. PW
