[Perspectives] Adding register & expressions view by default to debug perspective fails

Using Eclipse 3.0.1, you cannot configure the debug perspective to have the Registers and Expressions view open by default (for use with CDT). This was tried using the perspective extension point, see below: <extension point="org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions"> <perspectiveExtension targetID="org.eclipse.debug.ui.DebugPerspective"> <view relative="org.eclipse.debug.ui.VariableView" visible="true" relationship="stack" id="org.eclipse.debug.ui.RegisterView"> </view> </perspectiveExtension> This works for other views like Memory view. Looking around in the code for the debug perspective, these two views seem to get special treatment, with the following code (from DebugPerspectiveFactory): toolsFolder.addPlaceholder(IDebugUIConstants.ID_EXPRESSION_VIEW); toolsFolder.addPlaceholder(IDebugUIConstants.ID_REGISTER_VIEW); This seems to prevent user from configuring these views as default
