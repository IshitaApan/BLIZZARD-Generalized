[Markers] Problems list needs a tooltip for description field

Created attachment 109376 Problems tab view with long error messages Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: Have a look at the attached screenshot. It often happens that I get long compile errors, but can't read them completely because the problems tab view is not wide enough. Unfortunately there is no easy way to see the complete error message: - There is no tooltip appearing when I hover the mouse over it. - In the context menu, I can only select "Properties" and see a dialog box, where the error message appears in the "Description" field, which is also too short. - Even if I maximize the "Problems Tab" I still have to resize the first column to see the complete message. And sometimes the message still doesn't fit. I think it would be good to have a tooltip view, like for the code (with the "Press F2 to focus"), and also maybe improve the "Properties" dialog or add a "Show details" dialog. More information:
