[Progress] Progress of a Job doesn't reflect correctly in Progress Monitor View

Progress Monitor View is used to show progress of various asynchronous jobs running. A typical use is to create a sub-class of org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job and provide an implementation of the "IStatus run(IProgressMonitor monitor)" method. While running the job, IProgressMonitor object needs to be updated to reflect the progress. Suppose that the length of task is not known, it is indicated by calling beginTask method: 	monitor.beginTask(msg, IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN); In such cases, since the length of the task is unknown, the progress monitor bar in the progress monitor view is supposed to grow till the maximum, and shrink back to beginning (just as it happens all the time at the right bottom corner of the Eclipse window). Some time it doesnâ€™t happen, and the progress bar is blank (with zero progress) during the life of the job.
