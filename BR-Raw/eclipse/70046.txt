No progress when copying project

Build: 3.0 final 1) Create a large project (I imported org.eclipse.jdt.ui as a source plugin) 2) In the Navigator view, select the project, and pick "Copy" 3) Right click again and select paste -> The copy operation occurs, but there is never any progress message, and the progress bar is stuck at 50% for the entire duration. Looking at CopyProjectOperation.performCopyOperation. It does the following: 1) beginTask on the monitor with 100 units of work 2) Create the project description 3) Report 50 units of progress 4) Call IProject.copy, passing in the 50% complete monitor 5) Report another 50 units of progress Problems: - Realistically creating the description represents a negligible amount of work, and shouldn't account for any progress, let alone 50%. - You should never pass a half used monitor to an API call. It should instead pass a new SubProgressMonitor
