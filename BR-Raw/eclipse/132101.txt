[Field Assist] does not work for characters that need AltGr, Ctrl+Alt or Strg+Alt

I20060314-1200 The new field assist support does not work for characters that need 'AltGr' key to be typed in. 'AltGr' is a shortcut for 'Ctrl' + 'Alt' or 'Strg' + 'Alt' ('Ctrl' is labelled 'Strg' on some keyboards). Test Case: Make sure to change your keyboard layout to one that needs 'AltGr' to enter '\' or '[', for example a Swiss German keyboard layout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Swiss_German.2C_Swiss_French.2C_Liechtenstein.2C_Luxembourg 1. apply patch (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=35919) to I20060314-1200 2. start workbench 3. open Find/Replace on a text or Java file 4. make sure 'Regular Expressions' is checked 5. open code assist in the "Find:" entry field i.e. press 'Ctrl' + 'Space' 6. try to type in a character that needs 'AltGr' character, e.g. '[' or \' ==> does not work NOTE: if testing this on an English keyboard with Swiss German keyboard layout it can be tested by pressing 'Ctrl' + 'Alt' + '[' to enter the '[' character.
