[PropertiesDialog] Open up the API for org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.PropertyDialog

This request is to open up the API of org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.PropertyDialog. I need to perform some custom validations prior to displaying the properties dialog. I'm using actions and can subclass org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.PropertyDialogAction to perform the validations. I'm converting to commands and handlers, however, the handler equivalent of the action, PropertyDialogHandler, is in an internal package. Instead of making it public, it would be more flexible to make the PropertyDialog public. If the dialog were public it could be invoked from a custom handler (or action). By being public, the dialog would also allow callers to provide a custom initial page id or a custom element.
