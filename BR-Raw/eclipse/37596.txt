[DND] EditorArea DropAdapter not handling DROP_DEFAULT correctly

1) DND.DROP_DEFAULT is not a valid style - DND.DROP_DEFAULT | DND.DROP_COPY is what you want. In 3.0, with the style DND.DROP_DEFAULT, you will not get any drag and drop events in the DropTarget. DND.DROP_DEFAULT simply means that if there are no modifier keys pressed, the application can choose what operation will be performed but if the application does not specify any operations that are supported by the DragSource, it will never be informed of the DND operation. 2) DND.DROP_DEFAULT should be handled in DragEnter and DragOperationChanged. Currently it is being done in DragOver which is not the time when the operation can change. The current implementation results in cursor flicker and strange behaviour.
