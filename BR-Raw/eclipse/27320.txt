[Editor Mgmt] Editor tabs become unusable due to SWTExceptions

I have this happen quite frequently on 2.0.2 under Linux/Motif. For some reason, the editors become completely unusable. I end up with a single editor tab, which isn't painted correctly, and which has *no* corresponding editor contents. No editors can open, and this editor tab can't be closed. Attached is some of the resulting spewage to the log. I have to restart the workbench. Looks like someone's using a disposed image.
