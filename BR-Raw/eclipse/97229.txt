[Dialogs] ListSelectionDialog should be resizable by default

RC1 Open several editor and leave some dirty. Close all. The 'Save resources' dialog is not not resizable. I think it is always better to make dialogs resizable as this makes it easier for users with diffent font sizes or using very long names. -> make the ListSelectionDialog by default
