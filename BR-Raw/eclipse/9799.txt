Browse must be clicked twice in file import wizard

Build 20020212 1) File->Import->File System 2) Type a value in the directory selection combo at the top 3) Click Browse - directory dialog does not come up, instead it updates the list and tree below 4) Click browse a second time - now the dialog comes up. It looks like the checkbox tree is stealing focus when the button is pressed, and maybe this causes the selection event on the button not to fire?
