Scrolling up and down while dragging in the Navigator is not possible while a horizontal scroll bar is displayed.

If you have the Navigator displayed and a horizontal scroll bar and a vertical scroll bar is displayed you cannot drag and scroll. If you make the Navigator wider so that the horizontal scroll bar disappears you can now drag and scroll. To Reproduce: 1. Open up Eclipse 2. Open the Navigator 3. Create a couple of simple projects in the navigator 4. Add say 5 files to each project 5. Now shrink the Navigator until a vertical scroll bar appears 6. Drag a file from one project to the bottom of the other project note the navigator view scrolls 7. Now shrink the navigator so that a horizontal scroll bar appears 8. Drag a file from one project to the bottom (or top whatever is out of the screen) note the navigator view will not scroll.
