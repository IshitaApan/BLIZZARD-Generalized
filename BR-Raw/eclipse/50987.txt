API to know when a perspective reset finishes

The IPerspectiveListener API currently fires a "reset" event when a perspective is about to be reset. However, there is not event to inform listeners when the reset is complete. We would like a "resetComplete" notification because we have a part listener that we'd like to deregister during a reset. With the reset event, we know when to remove our listener. But we need the resetComplete to know when to add the listener back. We need to do this for our view context support, which automatically opens/closes views for the user. In order to minimize disruptiveness, we don't automatically open/close a view that the user has manually opened or closed. We do this with a part listener. This mechanism currently catches views that are closed during a perspective reset, but we don't want it to.
