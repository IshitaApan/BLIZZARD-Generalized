[UI] Allow the CSS engine access to the 'tag' info

We need to define multiple CSS 'class' names to allow clients to style against tag information (such as "View", "ViewStack"...). We will also add the model element's type ("MWindow", "MPart"...) This will allow for example style sheets that have all stacks use a particular tab style but also allow it to differentiate the style of a "PartStack" from that of an "EditorStack".
