QuickAccess command should appear in menu Window > Navigation

I20060906-1200 The new QuickAccess command (Ctrl+E, 'Window > QuickAccess' on Keys preference page) should appear in the menu 'Window > Navigation'. Furthermore, it's rather uncommon in Eclipse to use CamelCase command names. I would suggest to rename the command to 'Quick Access'.
