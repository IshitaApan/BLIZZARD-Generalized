dragging a view writes "Cross Boundary" to stdout

- 4.2M7 test build: I20120429-1800 - observed on Linux and HPUX, presumably happens on all platforms - start with a typical Java perspective open, no editors open - begin dragging the Problems view from the bottom up into the editor area - green rectangles showing the different drop zones are shown in the editor area - drop the dragged view into the bottom zone, and "Cross Boundary" will be written to stdout (I assume this is a debug string that was accidentally released)
