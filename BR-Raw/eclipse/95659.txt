[Workbench] Workbench#isRunning returns true when the event loop is not yet running

isRunning() returns the value of the boolean field runEventLoop, which is initialized to true upon creation of the Workbench instance. Therefore, PlatformUI#isWorkbenchRunning will return true as soon as the Workbench instance is created. It should probably return true only after the Workbench has been restored and/or initialized properly.
