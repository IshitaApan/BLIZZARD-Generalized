[Viewers] Add set/getStyleRanges to ViewerRow

20080327 set/getStyleRenges are on ViewerCell, using the data element on the row to store the ranges. They use a private constant as key. As an implementor of a ViewerRow, you want to get access to the styled ranges. ViewerCell is not implementable. The correct way therefor would be to also add set/getStyleRenges to ViewerRow where implementors can use it or even override it (if their widget supports styled ranges)
