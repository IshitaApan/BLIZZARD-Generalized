[JFace] "Clear" works incorrectly in filtered preference dialog

Build ID: Eclipse3.4.0 Steps To Reproduce: 1.In SampleAction run method, add below codes to filter preference dialog, only want to see "Plug-in Development" node in preference dialog. 		String [] displayIDs = {"org.eclipse.pde.ui.MainPreferencePage"}; 		PreferenceDialog dialog = PreferencesUtil.createPreferenceDialogOn(null, null, displayIDs, null); 		dialog.open(); 2.Click Sample Menu action. The filtered preference dialog is opened. 3.Input "aa" to input filter text, no node appears in the tree. It's correct. 4.Click "Clear" button. All notes appear in the tree, which is incorrect. Only the filtered node "Plug-in Development" should appear in the tree. We need to filter preference dialog in some conditions in the product, so needs the filtered dialog can not display hide notes by every UI entry. More information:
