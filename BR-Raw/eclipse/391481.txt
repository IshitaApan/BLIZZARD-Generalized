Contributing perspectiveExtension, hiddenMenuItem removes a menu from multiple perspectives

Created attachment 222083 Sample project showing the issue I noticed a problem in the perspective contributions, particularly perspectiveExtension, hiddenMenuItem, when I tried updating our product to Eclipse 4.2. I define two perspectives. I want one menu removed from one of the perspective. That works. The problem is that the menu is also removed from the other perspective. Is this a known issue? If so, it is planned to be addressed and when? I attached a small project demonstration the issues, and here are the steps to reproduce it: Import the attached plugin project in Eclipse 4.2 SDK. Start a launch configuration that clears the workspace. Open “My Edit Perspective” – see the “Run/Resume” menu is not there as expected by the contribution. Open “My Debug Perspective” – see the “Run/Resume” menu is not there. That is not what I expected. I only specified the menu to be removed from “My Edit Perspective”, not from “My Debug Perspective”.
