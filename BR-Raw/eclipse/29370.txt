[Dialogs] WizardNewProjectCreationPage.setInitalProjectName sets initialLocationFieldValue wrong

From EC: I create the main page using the WizardNewProjectCreationPage, for some > reason if I set the initial project name using the method > setInitalProjectName(String) in the WizardNewProjectCreationPage class, > and then add that page to the NewJavaProjectWizardPage and run the > runnable from that class when user selects "finish" button, > I get this error error Dialog: > > "Project Could not be created Reason: Invalid project description" and > under details I get this message: > "C:/Programs/eclipse/runtime-workspace/Demo Project and > C:/Programs/eclipse/runtime-workspace overlap." (Demo Project is the > name of the project that I want to set the default Projects name to.) > > What's weird is that this error only occurs if I use the method > setInitalProjectName(String) in the WizardNewProjectCreationPage class. > If i don't use that method ,and the user enters the name of the project > in that field box it works fine. However, I do want to have a default > value in that field. I think the problem is that initialLocationFieldValue is changed by setInitalProjectName. getLocationPath uses this value again.
