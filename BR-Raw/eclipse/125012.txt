[Field Assist] Clarify lifecycle of the ILabelProvider used by ContentProposalAdapter

I20060119-0800 Clients who want to port their field content assistants from jface.text.contentassist to jface.fieldassist would expect to be able to supply an image in IContentProposal, e.g. with a 'Image getImage();' method as in ICompletionProposal. Without icons, e.g. proposals for java type names would look quite different from the ones you get in the java editor. There's also a lot more functionality in ICompletionProposal and the 4 ICompletionProposalExtension* interfaces. Some of those concepts must also be supported in fieldassist if clients such as the Find/Replace dialog and Java type completions in dialogs should switch (e.g. the additionalProposalInfo to show documentation for regex proposals, etc.). I can file separate bugs for these functionalities if you want to discuss them one by one.
