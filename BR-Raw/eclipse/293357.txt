[context] Switch annotation processing to JSR 330

Created attachment 150546 Patch Now that JSR 330 has been approved and made its way into the Orbit ("javax.inject"), we can switch our injection annotations to it. On the consumer side the mapping it straightforward (old -> new): org.eclipse.e4.core.services.annotations.Inject -> javax.inject.Inject org.eclipse.e4.core.services.annotations.In -> javax.inject.Inject org.eclipse.e4.core.services.annotations.Named -> javax.inject.Named NOTE: Inject#optional(), In#optional() -> org.eclipse.e4.core.services.annotations.Optional There does not seem to be much need for @Optional so we might scrap this interface. It is only used with "optional(true)" and that should be a default. Dependencies: I'd recommend bundles that use javax.inject to include package dependency on it. The patch below adds those changes to E4 UI projects in CVS. The patch only changes interfaces over to JSR 330 and does not include changes for its TCKs.
