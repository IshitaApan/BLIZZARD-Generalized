[Dialogs] Clean dialog should remember "build immediately" setting

I like the recent changes to the build menu/dialogs. Thanks. However, shouldn't clean the dialog remember that I unchecked "Start a build immediately" the previous 999 times I said Clean? I'll admit this is unlikely to be a common scenario, but odds are if something causes you to do it once, you'll want to do it again and your choice should be preserved across invocations. To reproduce: Select Project->Clean... In the Clean? dialog, uncheck "start a build immediately" Select Project->Clean... "start a build immediately" is checked again
