[Workbench] Dual screen (Matrox DualHead MultiDisplay) startup only on one monitor

Hi, I'm working with two screens, connected to a Matrox "DualHead" Card... That configuration is if I maximize a program window, it maximize only on one of the two screens, but I can open it on the two screens (as if it was a unique wide screen) manually by extending edges of the window to the bounds of that "big" screen... With eclipse version 2.1 everything worked fine, at startup my eclipse window was using both screens as if I had a unique wide-wide screen. With 3.0 & 3.0.1 I have to resize my window manually each time I start eclipse up to fit on both screens. Strange is : -The splash screen appears on my left monitor -The window (not maximized, but open wide) fit only on the rightmost screen -I can manually fit the screen on the two screensby moving eclipse left edge to my leftmost screen left border. But nothing seems saved, and next time I'll startup eclipse I'll have to resize it manually again...
