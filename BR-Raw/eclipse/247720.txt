[FieldAssist] Field Assist Example password field mixes chars with *'s

3.5M2 candidate - when the Field Assist Example is shown its Password contains ***** - but when you type in the field non-* characters are shown - I'm not sure if this field should have style PASSWORD, or if *'s should be shown in the regular Text field, but showing the *'s initially and then showing regular characters when typing looks broken
