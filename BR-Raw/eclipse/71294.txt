Capabilities Preference Deselection.

Capabilities are difficult to deselect if they show up under several categories which is a real problem for our product because we have many capabilities being duplicated under serveral categories. Rather than the more elaborate solution suggested by 69143, I would like to propose this alternative low risk one so we can push it into 3.0.1. When a user unchecks a capability, a listener should pick up that event and ensure that all occurances of that capability are also unchecked in the tree. Likewise, when a capability is checked, all other occurances should also be checked. Similar logic should also be put in place so when a category is either checked or unchecked (and hence all the cabilities defined in it are as well) the changes are effected on all occurances of the capabilties defined under the category.
