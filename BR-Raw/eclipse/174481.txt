[ViewMgmt] Show View dialog selects wrong entry on Enter

I20070213-0907 - Open the Show View dialog and type "plug" - Select and open view "Plug-ins" - Open the Show View dialog again => "Plug-ins" is already selected (good) - type "pl" => depending on how fast you typed, different things happen: a) typed very fast: => "Plug-ins" stays selected (good) - press "Enter" => "Plug-in Dependencies" is selected. It's clearly wrong to select another entry on Enter. b) typed slowly => The folder "PDE" is selected, which does not make sense since they cannot be opened. I would expect that "Plug-ins" stays selected. - press "Enter" => "Plug-in Dependencies" is selected I would prefer if Enter just opened the selected view. Arrow_Down already moves the focus to the tree. The selection in the tree should not depend on typing speed, and it should be predictable. The originally selected view should stay selected as long as it matches the pattern. When the selected view gets removed from the tree, the selection should go to the next best match and stay there
