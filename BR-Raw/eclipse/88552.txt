[Contributions] Can't filter out actions from popup menu that are contributed by other plugins

Found in eclipse3.1M5a org.eclipse.compare use objectContribution on IFile and IResource to contribute menus to the popupextender, and they set adaptable=true. My multipage editor popup menu contains the above menu actions, and they appear to be contributed for the editor input (IFileEditorInput). I stepped into PopupMenuExtender's menuAboutToShow, and the actions are added from addEditorActions(mgr). I do not want the above menu contributions to appear in the graph view page of my two-page-editor, and I don't see any possible workaround. BTW, I'm not quite sure what is the effect of the adaptable attribute, because if I set adaptable=false in org.eclipse.compare's plugin.xml, then I don't see any of their menu contributions at all in my editor. My model objects are XSD Infoset Model objects...I'll have to check, but I don't believe they adapt IResource.
