[MPE] MultiPageEditorSite does not remove properly its KeyBindingService

Fix is bug 282046 attachment 144226 +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #282046 +++ Created an attachment (id=140521) Proposed patch in MultiPageEditorSite.dispose() Build ID: I20090611-1540 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Add a page (subclass of AbstractTextEditor) to a MultiPageEditorPart (method addPage) 2. Remove the page from the MultiPageEditorPart (method removePage) 3. The parent MultiPageEditorPart's KeyBindingService keeps a reference to the removed MultiPageEditorSite in its nestedServices HashMap, creating a memory leak until the parent MultiPageEditorPart is disposed More information: When the method getKeyBindingService is first called for a MultiPageEditorSite, its parent MultiPageEditorPart's KeyBindingService is created or retrieved, and then a new KeyBindingService for the MultiPageEditorSite is created and linked to the parent's KeyBindingService. But when the MultiPageEditorSite is disposed, for example by a call to removePage from the parent MultiPageEditorPart, the link to the nested service is attempted to be removed from the MultiPageEditorSite's KeyBindingService instead of the parent MultiPageEditorPart's KeyBindingService. This leaves a reference in memory to the disposed MultiPageEditorSite. As a result, the removed MultiPageEditorSite's contents (possibly an editor and all its data model) can not be garbage collected and remain in memory until the whole MultiPageEditorPart is disposed.
