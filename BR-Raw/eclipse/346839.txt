[Compatibility] Part service needs to be notified of part input changes

Build Identifier: I20110518-2200 After renaming the class (ie. via Refactor->Rename) and then attempting to open the super implementation of any of its methods (not by F3-ing on a super.method() call though) by clicking on the green up-arrow of overrideness (on the left of the method name, see picture), then an error dialog appears instead of the actual open in editor. this was in e4 4.1.0 I20110518-2200 Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: have these 2 java files: package org.some; public class Base { 	public void stuff(){ 	} } ========== package org.some; public class Sub extends Base { 	@Override 	public 			void 			stuff() 	{ 		super.stuff(); 	} } ========= 1. put your cursor on the Sub class and do a rename on it, ie. alt+shift+r and rename it to anything other than Sub (obviously) 2. then click(and release) left mouse button on the green up-arrow on the left of the stuff() method which means you would go to its super implementation. Looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/EV7op.png 3. you get this error message: http://i.imgur.com/hFtdJ.png to fix this just F3 (go to declaration) on the Base class on this line: "public class Sub2 extends Base" which will go/open the Base class you can also do this on the "super.stuff()" line, same thing. Then alt+left to go back in nav. history and now click the green up-arrow to go to super and it works. Note: even if Base is already open in editor (but not active), it will still fail to open its super when doing those reproduce-steps.
