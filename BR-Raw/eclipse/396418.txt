Command org.eclipse.ui.file.save always disabled

Created attachment 224632 Demo projects to reproduce the problem. After switching my RCP-based application from the RCP 3.x to the RCP 4.2.1 platform, the global org.eclipse.ui.file.save command is always disabled. When an editor becomes dirty, it correctly gains the "*" highlighting in the title, but the save button in the global workbench toolbar is not enabled. Thus, changes in the editor can only be saved via the "Save changes?" question when closing the editor. The same application works fine on the RCP 3.x platform. Please note: Some time ago, I filed this bug for the RAP platform (bug 375916) as I first thought it's just a problem of RAP. Now I realized that the problem also exists with the RCP platform. Attached, you can find a demo project to reproduce the problem. It comes with a target definition and a lauch configuration and can directly be executed from an Eclipse Juno IDE workspace. Thank you for any hints.
