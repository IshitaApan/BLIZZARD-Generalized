[ModelTooling] Undo/Redo not working in 4.0

It looks like there's a difference in how Undo/Redo is working in 3.x and 4.0. The model-editor has a single source and when running in a 3.x env the undo/redo is working whereas in 4.0 it's not. It could naturally be that I'm doing something which only works by chance in 3.x but because this code part is more or standard when writing Editors with undo/redo I'd not be suprised if other editors 3rd party code would have the same problem. The code in question is in: * org.eclipse.e4.tools.emf.editor3x.E4WorkbenchModelEditor * org.eclipse.e4.tools.emf.editor3x.UndoAction * org.eclipse.e4.tools.emf.editor3x.RedoAction You can reproduce this quite easy by installing the E4 Tools from the e4 2010 Updates - http://download.eclipse.org/e4/updates/2010
