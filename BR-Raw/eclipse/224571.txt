[Decorators] Missing problem markers on IFile in Package Explorer

I20080327-2251. Warnings and errors are no longer seen on IFiles in the Package Explorer. Still works for IContainer and Java elements. Affected are all PDE markers for example. I debugged this down to the fix for bug 146951 which adds a 'More Specific File Icons' decorator which seems not to decorate but REPLACE what was there so far - hence no more problem decorations. Not good and most likely this breaks many other clients. This should get fixed for M6 as it is very confusing to see an error or warning on the project but no marker in one of its resources. At least don't enable that 'More Specific File Icons' decorator per default for M6. I file bug for the name of that filter as I have no idea what exactly 'More Specific File Icons' means.
