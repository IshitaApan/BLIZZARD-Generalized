[IDE] Need file pathname in titlebar

Currently, Eclipse displays the name of the active file in the titlebar. It would be nice to have the full pathname followed by the filename in the titlebar. example, instead of displaying only: MyClass.java display: /src/framework/model/domain/MyClass.java This is useful for a number of reasons: 1. To distinguish based on path, classes that have the same name. 2. For projects with multiple root directories, to tell where in the directory stucture one is currently editing. 3. Is an easy fix!
