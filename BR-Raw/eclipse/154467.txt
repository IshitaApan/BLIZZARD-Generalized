[WorkingSets] (Patch attached) Smart selection of single WorkingSets

If you open the "Select Working Set" dialog, you can check an item in the list and press ok to activate this Working set. If you do a double click in the list, nothing happens (not nothing, but nothing visible for the user). The dialog is closed and nobody knows whats going on. Here is a patch to extend the dialog by selecting the working set you double.clicked on.
