[Workbench] AbstractUIPlugin should have start(...) and stop(...) methods

Build I20040420 AbstractUIPlugin should have start(...) and stop(...) methods. Currently, it only has startup() and shutdown() methods. A plug-in's startup() and shutdown() methods get called only if that plug-in explicitly requires org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility. A plug-in's start(..) and stop(..) methods get called all the time. We (Jeff and I) believe that the correct behavior in AbstractUIPlugin will be achieved by: (a) replacing public void startup() throws CoreException { 	refreshPluginActions(); } by public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception { super.start(context); refreshPluginActions(); } (2) replacing public void shutdown() throws CoreException { 	super.shutdown(); 	saveDialogSettings(); 	savePreferenceStore(); 	preferenceStore = null; 	imageRegistry = null; } by public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception { try { 	saveDialogSettings(); 	savePreferenceStore(); 	preferenceStore = null; 	imageRegistry = null; } finally { 	super.stop(context); } }
