[Dialogs] TitleAreaDialog does not short circuit if message is null

M20080911-1700 When profiling use of a custom WizardDialog on Linux/GTK, a lot of time was spent in WizardPage.setMessage(...). It turns out that this was because we were setting a message of null after each keypress, and the page's description (DialogPage.getDescription()) was also null. In this case the short-circuit in TitleAreaDialog.setMessage(String, int) fails to notice that the message has not changed, and does a layout every time. For our dialog this takes about 40ms each time, which is noticeable when compounded with other work.
