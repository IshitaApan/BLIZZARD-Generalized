[DataBinding] DecoratingObservable should self-dispose when the decorated observable is disposed

DecoratingObservable should dispose itself in response to the disposal of its decorated observable. One thing we'll have to address is that all existing observables may call firstListenerAdded() / lastListenerRemoved() in response to an addDisposeListener() / removeDisposeListener() call. We should try to eliminate this case to avoid hooking listeners when all we're interested in is disposal.
