After splitting the editor work area into multiple tiles, files open in the original editor work area instead of the focused one

Build Identifier: Version: 4.2.0 Build id: I20120608-1400 In all other versions of Eclipse, after tiling the editor work area, newly opened files would appear in whichever editor work area had focus. In this version, they open in the Original work area regardless of the amount of editor work area tiles. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Grab an editor or view tab and drag it to the edge of the editor work area. 2.The green drop rectangles indicate which way the editor work area will split. 3.Focus the editor work area tile and open a file with either CTRL-SHIFT-R or by hitting F3 on a selected link. 4.The new editor will open in the original editor work area.
