[Wizards] Import from Filesystem dialog does not always give file-list

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: When using the Eclipse importer from "File system" I encounter two situations where the panes showing directories and files do not repaint without further user actions. Scenario 1: when pasing directory name into "From directory" Scenario 2: after navigating to directory using Browse... button, then clicking Back and Next buttons in sequence The symptom in both cases is that after selecting the directory, I expect to see the folder name in the LH pane and a list of files to choose in the RH pane. Instead they remain blank until further action is taken: In scenario 1: Click in the 'From directory:' field of the Import wizard of the tooling, then Ctrl-V to paste the path into the field. You will see nothing in either pane below the field, even if you press Enter. There are several ways to make files appear: - switch focus to a different application; the left-hand pane will magically be populated. - or: click on one of the 2 panes below. Clicking on the left one populates both panes; clicking on the right pane only populates the left pane. - or: click on Browse... to the right of the field to see the directory highlighted. Click OK and the left pane will be populated. In scenario 2: The directory listing appears when you OK the initial selection of directory. But clicking Back then Next on the wizard leaves you with the "From directory:" still showing the right value, the LH pane populated, but the RH pane empty. More information: I agree it is possible to get the file list to appear and once I have selected files, they do import. However the wizard behaviour could be improved, particularly in the use case when I cut+paste the directory from another application. I have tested this only on Windows XP (SP2). No stack traces were produced here.
