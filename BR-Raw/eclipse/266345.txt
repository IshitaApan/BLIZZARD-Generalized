[Progress] WorkbenchSiteProgressServiceTest's testWaitCursor() is failing

Created attachment 126870 WorkbenchSiteProgressServiceTest patch v1 Build id: I20090224-0800 I don't think it failed before on my computer but it's failing now anyway. junit.framework.AssertionFailedError 	at junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:47) 	at junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:20) 	at junit.framework.Assert.assertNotNull(Assert.java:217) 	at junit.framework.Assert.assertNotNull(Assert.java:210) 	at org.eclipse.ui.tests.services.WorkbenchSiteProgressServiceTest.testWaitCursor(WorkbenchSiteProgressServiceTest.java:78) It seems that the cursor is null, for whatever reasons. It seems that the forced invocation of the job is not causing the cursor switch because it's the runnable is asynchronously executed, hence, I suppose it may be delayed (which seems to be the case on my computer). I've attached a patch that seems to fix the problem on my end. I'm not sure if it's the right way to go, though.
