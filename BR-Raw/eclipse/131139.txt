Animated errors in wizards are disturbing and incomplete

I20060307-1315 The animated error message that appeared e.g. in the New Java Class wizard has a number of problems: 1) Warnings are not animated, but errors are. This is inconsistent. 2) Errors only appear delayed. Everywhere else, messages are shown immediately, and that is good. 3) The animation is distracting and does not fit the style of Eclipse. Our users appreciate immediate feedback and are not keen on waiting until an ad-like popup appears. 4) The original message is still shown when an error appears. If the original message took 2 lines (see e.g. New JUnit Test Case wizard), the error is shown partially above it, cutting parts of the message. Also, existing implementors of TitleAreaDialogs expect that the description is not shown when they set an error message. This is a breaking change. 5) The implementation gets confused with simple steps: - select a source package and open the New Java Class Wizard - type "my", select the whole type name, type "My" => "Type name is empty." error is still shown, although the field was never empty. In summary, my vote is to turn this change back for 3.2.
