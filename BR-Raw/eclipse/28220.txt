[Linked Resources] Project rename does a DEEP move

Build I20021210 1) Create a project with a linked file 2) Rename the project 3) The file is no longer a linked file. The file that was linked to has been moved into the default content area of the project. This is because the rename action (RenameResourceAction) is not specifying the SHALLOW flag when moving the project: if (resource.getType() == IResource.PROJECT) { 	IProject project = (IProject) resource; 	IProjectDescription description = project.getDescription(); 	description.setName(newPath.segment(0)); 	project.move(description, true, monitor); } else 	resource.move(newPath, IResource.KEEP_HISTORY | IResource.SHALLOW, new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 50));
