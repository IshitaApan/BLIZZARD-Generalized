[Import/Export] ILeveledImportStructureProvider interface is not declared public

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. This is not a run-time issue. It is an issue with a missing "public" keyword on an Eclipse interface. 2. 3. More information: In the file org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/ILeveledImportStructureProvider.java, the keyword "public" is not present before the interface declaration. The line is just: interface ILeveledImportStructureProvider extends IImportStructureProvider { instead of public interface ILeveledImportStructureProvider extends IImportStructureProvider { In the same directory, the files IDataTransferHelpContextIds.java and IFileExporter.java contain public interfaces. Without the keyword public, the interface is only visible to the package and can not be experimented with in other plugins. It is understood that the interface is still internal and its usage is discouraged. Not having the "public" keyword seems inconsistent with the other interfaces in the same package and counter to the policy described in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Export-Package Please add the "public" keyword. Thanks.
