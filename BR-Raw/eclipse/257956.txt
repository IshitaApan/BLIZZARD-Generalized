[Markers] Improvement requests to Problems View / Configure Contents dialog

Hello, I have two requests for the Configure Contents dialog of the Problems View: 1. Add 'rename' button to configuration dialog. For instance, I _never_ want "Warnings on Selection" as a configuration. I want "All on Selection". So I'd like to be able to just rename that configuration and then adjust the severity. 2. Add 'duplicate' button to configuration dialog. Another way to solve the problem listed above is to allow me to make a copy of the 'Warnings on Selection' configuration, and change it there. Of course, the 'Duplicate' button could follow up with a dialog asking for the new configuration name, but I'd prefer a predicted name (e.g. Warnings on Selection(2)) and a rename button. Thanks!
