[Contributions] Need EditorPluginAction and ActionDescriptor.ATT_DEFINITION_ID as API

I20050104-1600 Since 2.0 Platform Text uses references the following internal code: ActionDescriptor.ATT_DEFINITION_ID new EditorPluginAction(...) This is needed in AbstractTextEditor.findContributedAction(...) to create the editor actions contributed via org.eclipse.ui.editorActions extension point. We would at least like to get EditorPluginAction as API for 3.1. ActionDescriptor.ATT_DEFINITION_ID is nice to have i.e. we can copy that string if necessary. Please tell whether you plan to do this for 3.1 or not. If not, we copy the code for EditorPluginAction and its super types because we want to get clean for 3.1 (references to internal code of other plug-ins is now part of the build results).
