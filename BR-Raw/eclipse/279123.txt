[UI] View's context menus are over written with the contents from the drop-down menu

This appeared once we started populating legacy parts with menu and tb models... There is code in the PartRenderer that 'automatically' creates Menus and Toolbars from the existing model structures if they exist. Unfortunately it also calls 'setMenu' on the 'owning' control. For legacy parts the MMenu available through 'getMenu' is the 'drop down' menu that appears when you click on the drop down button on the view's toolbar. The control's menu for these parts is managed by the view's implementation itself.
