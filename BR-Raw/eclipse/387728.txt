[KeyBindings] Changing the keybindings to Emacs+ unstable

Steps to reproduce: ------------------- Install Eclipse 4.2 JEE. Add the Emacs+ software update site: Emacs+ - http://www.mulgasoft.com/emacsplus/juno/update-site Install the plugins: - Emacs+ - Emacs+ options Accept to restart. Go to Window-Preferences-General-Keys and select the Emacs+ scheme. Symptoms -------- - after selecting the new scheme, it often doesn't do anything (e.g. ctrl+p and ctrl+n inside the editor don't actually move the cursor, but open a print or new.. dialog) - one has to do the following steps to get the change of bindings accepted: + Change the binding scheme to default + Select the Restore Defaults button + Exit Preferences + Re-enter Preferences -> General -> Keys + Re-enable the scheme Emacs+ Scheme - after a restart, the bindings sometimes turn back to default - sometimes (I think when connecting to an Eclipse 3.x workspace, can't reproduce it reliably) a pop-up bubble shows up when there are duplicate keybindings (e.g. "home" and "end" keys) where the user has to choose which of these he meant (and they are usually the same in practice - such as "forward word" vs "next word").
