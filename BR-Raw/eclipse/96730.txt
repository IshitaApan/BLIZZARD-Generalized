[Undo] - action not properly updated on failed operation with multiple contexts

Found this hole while doing Manual Undo/Redo Test Scenarios: scenario 7 - <correct handling of operation failure inside LinearUndoViolationUserApprover> If an operation fails during a linear undo violation, it's possible that the triggering undo context gets flushed from the failing operation. If there are other operations of that context in the history, the action handlers will properly update as these operations get removed. However, if the only operations that have the undo context also have other contexts, there is nothing actually removed from the history, and the action handler won't get further notifications. This means that when the action handler gets the original notification of the failure, it needs to always update the action after the flush, rather than relying on subsequent notifications.
