[Preferences] Autorefresh polling preference presentation

Build 20040127 The way the polling preference is presented makes it look like the autorefresh feature relies on polling to do its job. Unless things have changed since Jed wrote it, however, autorefresh normally doesn't poll at all, but relies on natives for "interrupt-driven" updates. The polling preference should somehow let the user know that it will only be used if the native notifications fail. Ideally, the autorefresh plug-in should know whether or not the native support is there, so it should be able to tell the user whether or not the preference will have any effect. Maybe, the preference could even be hidden if the autorefresh plug-in detects that it won't be used? At the very least, though, there should be text there (even if it has to be verbose) to inform the user of the setting's implications.
