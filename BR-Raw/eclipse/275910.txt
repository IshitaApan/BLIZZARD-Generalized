[Widgets] PaintListener on Tree not invoked when item count is 0

Created attachment 135399 Test program Build ID: I20090430-2300 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Run the attached program, PaintListenerTest. 2. In the "Controller" tab, press the button. 3. Switch to the "Tree" tab. There is 1 item in the tree. "paintControl" should have been printed to stdout. 4. Repeat step 2. 5. Switch to the "Tree" tab again. There are no items in the tree. This time nothing was printed to stdout - the paint listener was not invoked. More information: I'm working on an application that has trees in a tab folder, where any tree's content can change while it is not showing. They can have many nodes, and refreshing is slow, so instead of refreshing every time I'm marking the tree dirty and waiting for a PaintEvent. But when the tree is empty the PaintEvent is not received.
