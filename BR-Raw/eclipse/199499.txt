Switching tabs by Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown must not be caught on the inner tab set

This issue is a follow-up from bug #155364 where it is explained in details. The original issue blamed WTP and their XML editor, but I was told that it needs to be handled in Eclipse platform. Just a short summary: When there are two sets of tabs like with the XML editor switching between those tabs gets "caught" on the inner tab set. This means it's not possible to leave the inner tab set "design"/"source" of the XML editor by switching to the next tab of the outer set (next editor). The idea for changing this behavior is to let the next Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown at the end of the inner tab set switch to the next tab of the outer tab set. So it would be again possible to navigate through all editor tabs with Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown. A duplicate of bug #155364, bug #198849 (which finally triggered this issue I wanted to add nearly 1 year ago) also recommends this solution.
