[statushandling] More helpful error dialogs

Often when an error happens, like in bug 264093, you get a small error dialog, and then a button to show the details. The details are usually some cryptic unmeaningful line (which is the exception message text usually). However the good stuff is in the log. The problem is that most people don't know to look in the log, and don't know there is good stuff. It would be really nice to have a button or something that would get the whole contents of the exception (like the log entry) and put it in the clipboard. This way it would be really easy to file a bug. At a minimum there should be some text suggesting to look in the log for more information. I mean, I have been using Eclipse for a while, and I forget that this stuff is in the log. Think about the person who is not as experienced. I think if we do this right, we will get a lot more good bug reports with stack traces, and be able to capture intermittent problems more easily. I would be happy to work with someone on this.
