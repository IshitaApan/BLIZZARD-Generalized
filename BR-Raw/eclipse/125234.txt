[Help] Missing context help

There are many instances of missing context help in the eclipse UI, particularly in dialogs that are not frequently used. Rather than having me list each instance I suggest going through the dialogs, preference pages, property pages, views, editors, wizards, etc and adding help along the way where it is missing. The addition of the help button in dialogs will make missing context more obvious to users. Here are a few examples: Preferences: General: Capabilities: Advanced... -> resulting dialog Editors page Workspace: Build Order: Add Project.. -> resulting dialog (help is too general) Linked Resources: page itself New.. -> resulting dialog Views: Tasks: Toolbar buttons: Add Task -> resulting dialog Filters -> resulting dialog View menu: Sorting.. -> resulting dialog Preferences.. -> resulting dialog Bookmarks: Right click on bookmark -> Properties -> resulting dialog I realize there are other bugs open for missing context help but they are for specific examples. I'm not sure how you want to handle this.. here are other related bugs: bug 66965 bug 67119 bug 67101 bug 67115
