[WorkingSets] Updater class for resource working sets

I20051025-0800 JDT is getting more and more requests that the package explorer is able to show resource working sets as well as Java working sets. I added some code to the package explorer that enables showing resource working sets iff the top level elements of the working set are projects (otherwise it will be difficult to ensure that we don't show the "same" element twice once as a resource and once as a Java element). The code is working however the correct updating of the package explorer depends on having a working set updater installed. This is the case for Java working sets but not for resource working sets. Since Java working sets can show simple resources as well I simply extracted the code to a ResourceWorkingSetUpdater which I would like to contribute to Platform/UI. Nick, I have assigned the PR directly to you since you looked at the working set updater patches in 3.1.
