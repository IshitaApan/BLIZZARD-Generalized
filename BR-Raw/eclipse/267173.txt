[Linked Resources] Data loss when replacing one linked resource with another using drag and drop

Build ID: HEAD Steps To Reproduce: I've got a Group with some links to folders. If I drag and drop a linked folder from another workspace path, into the group, I get the dialog saying: "project/group/linked_folder" already exists. Do you wish to overwrite? Folder contents will be merged existing files will be overwritten. In my case I had selected a bunch of linked resources to drag into the group, (some of which are identical to the links already in the group). So I pressed "Yes To All". The result is an error: "Resource is out of sync with the filesystem: ..." The move operation has actually tried to replace a file with itself, and this fails (and the resulting file is empty...). I find this completely counter-intuitive. If I'm replacing a linked resource with another, I don't want a recursive merge. I want to replace the link, just like aliases in a filesystem...
