<response_by> martine marin at 2010.05.10.08.54.03 </response_by> Hi, The drop-down list is truncated for Select File System when you click Advanced on this panel. Build: 20100509-1500 Language: French Steps to reproduce: Right-click the new empty project and select New > Other... Select EMF Generator Model under Eclipse Modeling Framework Click Next Click "Advanced >>" button The text for "default" is truncated. Please enlarge size of the box to allow for full text "valeur par d?faut" to be displayed. Same for testcase 09.000.300 (see attached capture) Thanks a lot in advance, Martine <response_by> rewagner at 2010.05.10.16.23.40 </response_by> This article was reassigned from Category:''TVT/Testing,Inbox''.
