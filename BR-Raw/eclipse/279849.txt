[UI] StackModelFactory should not be setting setMax/MinVisible

The StackModelFactory makes calls to 	ctf.setMaximizeVisible(showMinMax); 	ctf.setMinimizeVisible(showMinMax); These should be (and can be) done via CSS since they are purely decorative. We should remove the calls from the StackModelFactory.
