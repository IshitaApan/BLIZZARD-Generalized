[Wizards] WizardNewProjectCreationPage doesn't validate on startup

I construct this page and use the setInitialProjectName() to set a default name. The project name field is set properly, but the default project location doesn't append this initial project name to the end of it. If I uncheck and then recheck the checkbox, the project location field is set how I thought it should have been set. The second problem is that validatePage() is called within createControl(), but the return value is not used in a call to setPageComplete(). I tried doing this myself, but validatePage() is private and the project location field is also private! Basically the functionality that is desired is the ability to set a default project name for the user, and make the page complete (as long as the project doesn't already exist of course, but the validatePage should handle this). I'm using this in our XML example wizards for WSAD. Thanks, Ernest
