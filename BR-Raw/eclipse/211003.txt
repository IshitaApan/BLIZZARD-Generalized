[CommonNavigator] [Common Navigator] link with editor property is the same as title image

When calling setTitleImage on a common navigator part, the link with editor state is updated since CommonNavigator.IS_LINKING_ENABLED_PROPERTY = 1 and IWorkbenchPartConstants.PROP_TITLE = 1. These two constants should have a different value so that the title and title image can be changed on the part without the link with editor property changing.
