[Markers] Filtering ion Problems view should allow "ANDing" filter conditions

I am trying to make use of the filter settings in ProblemView, but apparently the misc. filters are OR-ed. I want to filter away several types of warnings but can't do so, because conditions are apparently OR'ed instead of AND-ed. Usecase: I don't want to see warnings that contain the substring "(The field <foo>).COPYRIGHT is never read locally" nor warnings containing "(The field <foo>).COPYRIGHT is hiding a field from type (<bar>)" (note: the parts in bracket I only included for clarity. My filters of course only specify the parts outside the brackets). I realize that I could specify a single filter just using ".COPYRIGHT is" but that might inadvertedly also hide other warnings that I might be interested in. And occasionally I also would like to enable additional filters like "<foo> should be tagged with @Override since ..." or "... is emulated by a synthetic aceessor method. Increasing its visibility will improve ...". Changing filters is easier and quicker for such temporary adaptations than changing compilation pref's and rebuilding everything. Michael
