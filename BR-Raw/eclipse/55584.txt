[ViewMgmt] Lazy view initialization is broken

200403220800 1) Fire up a workspace and create a java project that contains errors and a TODO tag 2) Ensure that both the problems and tasks view exist and are in the same part folder. Select Problems. 3) Close down eclipse 4) Restart eclipse Note that even the tab that has not been selected yet is bold. This would indicate that the part exists. In M7 and previous, the view was not created until the tab was first selected. Nick believes this is a consequence of the job work. In the PresentableViewPart constructor we're calling pane.getViewReference().getPart(true).getSite(); This has the side effect of creating the view. We should only hook the property listener onto the part when we know it exists, perhaps in the setVisible() method.
