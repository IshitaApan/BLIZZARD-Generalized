[Contributions] Need  getCommandContributionItemParameter in CommandContributionItem

Build ID: I20090512-2000 Steps To Reproduce: Please add getCommandContributionItemParameter() in CommandContributionItem in org.eclipse.ui.workbench plugin. Our application has our own presentation factory, and creates our own custom coolbar and toolbar, instead of using SWT standard ToolBar. So we have our own versions of custom CoolBar, CoolItem, ToolBar, ToolItem, also custom CoolBarManager, ToolBarManager, ToolBarContributionItem, ActionCiontributionItem so on,and they are created in our presentation factory. In our contributin item, we have fill(CustomToolBar toolbar, int index) to create a widget. So, now we found org.eclipse.ui.menu can not add contributions to toolbar in our application. Because we are using CustomToolBar widget, We tried to create a wrapper class of CommandContributionItem to impelement fill(CustomToolBar, int) in it. To do that, only the thing we need in Eclipse is to have getCommandContributionItemParameter() in CommandContributionItem. More information:
