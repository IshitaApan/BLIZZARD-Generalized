createExistentResourceFromHandle forgets to create children resources

Problem: The method FolderDescription#createExistentResourceFromHandle(IResource,IProgressMonitor) checks if the folder already exists and returns immediately if so. In cases where the FolderDescription has members which are not existing at that moment, that members will not be created. Use case: Assume you want to create a folder and a file in that folder and use two operations for this. I know it is not necessary to use two operations but my configuration is more complex than this example code. IFolder folder = ... // must not exist CreateFolderOperation op1 = new CreateFolderOperation(folder,...); IFile file = folder.getFile(...); // must not exist CreateFileOperation op1 = new CreateFileOperation(file,...); op1.execute(...); op2.execute(...); The execution of the op2 does not create the file because as stated above createExistentResourceFromHandle returns immediately because the parent folder of the file was created by op1. IMHO createExistentResourceFromHandle must check if members of a FolderDescription should be created.
