Dialog.applyDialogFont should protect itself against null arguments

RC2 Now that many plugins use this method to apply the dialog font to widgets the method should protect itself against null arguments. Normally clients create their widget tree in a method createControl and there are changes that the returned control might be null. Adding a statement Dialog.applyDialogFont (result) with result == null will result in new NPEs.
