[Wizards] PageTransition classes may need rename/reorg

After the fix for bug 16179 we now have the following classes that appear to be the same or similar: PageTransitionEvent, PageChangedEvent IPageTransitionListener, IPageChangedListener IPageTransitionProvider, IPageChangeProvider Bug 16179 added PageTransition event, provider and listener classes that are to be fired when a wizard page is transitioning. Whereas the PageChanged classes are fired after the page is shown. The naming of the *Transition classes may cause confusion so there have been a few proposals to improve this: 1. simply change the word "transition" to "changing" 2. remove the new classes and instead evolve the PageChanged classes to incorporate the "changing" behavior by adding a pageChanging method (i.e. add an IPageChangedListener2 interface). I think we discussed a third option - not to use an event at all and just add an aboutToShow() method to DialogPage. I would like the opinions of the API gurus before proceeding on this - it will need to be resolved for M5.
