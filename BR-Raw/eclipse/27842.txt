[Working Sets] What is a working set type?

Build: 20021204 When I open the New Working Set dialog for the first time (and let's say I know nothing about working sets). I have no idea which type to select. I have to guess which type I want based off of the name of the type. At this point in time, all of the names are very terse, so they don't give me much help. It would make it easier for me to choose if working set types came with descriptions so that I could click on each on, and a description would be display which would help me choose my type. The dialog would have to be modified in order to display the description, what I am envisioning is something like the Label Decorations preference page. For example, when I select the Java type, a text area would populate with text similar to, "The Java working set type allows the selection of Java and Java related resources, this includes .java, .class, and .jar files." Something like that would make me more confident in my working set type selection. As a workaround, we could suggest that more descriptive names be used.
