Next Editor, Next View, Next Perspective incorrectly centering on multi-monitor systems

The "list widget" that displays when the hot key for "Next Editor", "Next View", and "Next Perspective" is pressed, centers itself across the whole desktop area. For multi-monitor systems (assuming a side by side layout), this means the list appears half on one monitor and half on the other, even though the main workbench window is only displayed on one monitor. The list that appears should probably be centered on the workbench window's rectangle and then possibly clipped on the desktop area in the case a user has the workbench window hanging "off" the desktop by a substantial amount. "Non-standard" desktop areas could alert the code to a potential multi-monitor configuration. If the desktop isn't a standard dimension for the user's platform, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, etc...multiple monitors (or some scrolling desktop feature of the video driver) is in use.
