Minor usability problems with progress view errors

Build: 20030813 Some minor usability/presentation issues with the progress view's handling of errors: 1) The action for clearing a single error is called "Delete", and the action for clearing all errors is "Clear All Errors". I suggest using the same verb for both actions ("Clear" and "Clear All Errors"). 2) There is no action associated with double click. I suggest mapping double-click to "Show Error" for error jobs. 3) When you open an error dialog on a status, it creates a silly dialog if you pass the status message as well as the status object. You end up with "An error occurred" Reason: "An error occurred" It's better to pass null as the error message, and then ErrorDialog will take the message from the status object and not duplicate it.
