[CommonNavigator] Can't drag objects from Data Source Explorer

Build ID: I20090313-0100 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Open the DSE View 2.connect a profile (such as one to Derby) 3.Click on an item in the database tree and attempt to drag it. In previous releases of Eclipse, the drag icon would appear and objects could be dropped onto another view with a dropListener. Now, nothing happens. More information: I am running with DTP 1.7(dtp-sdk-1.7.0M7-200904030500), Eclipse 3.5 (eclipse-SDK-3.5M6-win32), EMF 2.5 (emf-xsd-SDK-2.5.0M6), GEF 3.5 (GEF-runtime-3.5.0M6). There are changes in the CommonDragAdapter (bugzilla 264323) which may effect this.
