[Graphics] Improve Look and Feel of FilteredTree

I think the L&F of the FilteredTree is not yet optimal. I am using variants of it in my own projects, since the functionality is quite cool. For some ideas how the widget could be improved, see the attached screenshots. If there is a plan to adapt some of the ideas, I can contribute patches based on my own work. Ben
