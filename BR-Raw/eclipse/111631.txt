[Viewers] TreeViewer needs more TableViewer API

As the TreeViewer is meant to replace the TableTreeViewer we need to add some of the API that the TableViewer had to it so that it can be used like a table. 	public void insert(Object element, int position) 	public void add(Object[] objects) Both need to be added.
