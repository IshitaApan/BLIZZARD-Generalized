[Compatibility] Perspectives with standalone views lay out incorrectly

Build Identifier: I20110620-1631 In the process of testing conversion of an Eclipse 3.6 based RCP app to E4, I came across an issue where a perspective made of of standalone views does not lay out correctly. The views show up in the wrong positions. If the views are switched to "normal" (non-standalone) views, then they show up in the correct positions. I am attaching screenshots and a patch against the RCP mail demo application that demonstrate the issue. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a perspective with a layout of 4 standalone views as demonstrated in the attached patch 2. Run the application and open the perspective from step 1 3. Observe the views being placed into the incorrect positions
