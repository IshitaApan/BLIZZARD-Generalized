[Decorators] CompositeImageDescriptor: Problem on overlay with transparent areas in PNG

I have PNG file and overlay with GIF file. Problem: In result, transparent areas of PNG are filled with black. I've found same problem sent on newsgroup some time ago: http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform.swt/msg20912.html without answer There was other problem, maybe related: "Using PNG with Alpha channel in SWT Widgets" http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform.swt/msg15929.html From there I went to bugzilla and see that bug: "Problems with PNG transparency in Image Class" https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35040 My class is extending CompositeImageDescriptor with this method implemented: protected void drawCompositeImage(int width, int height) { drawImage(base, 0, 0); drawImage(overlay, 0, height - overlay.height); } protected Point getSize() { Point point = new Point(base.width, base.height); return point; }
