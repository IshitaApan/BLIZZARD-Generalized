[Markers] can't easily sort Problems view by severity

I20060119-0800 In 3.1, I could easily sort the Problems view by severity by clicking on the title of the first column (which held the icons and made the severity accessible for screen readers) With recent builds, this is not possible any more, since the severity column has been integrated into the description column also when not in hierarchical mode. I'd like to have the severities column back at least in flat mode.
