DBCS3.6: Resource Filter UI didn't restore grouped filters

Build Identifier: I20100313-1044 When reopening Resource Filters property editor after adding several filters under either of top-level AND/OR/NOT group, none of children in such top-level group filter is shown while settings are actually persisted in .project. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a project and add some files and folders. 2. Add resource filters to the project or the folder just created, and filters are grouped by AND/OR/NOT. 3. Ensure filters are active for exiting resources under the project. 4. Reopen "Resource Fileters" property editor 5. Verify the filters added in Step 2 are restored. Problem: None of child filters under top-level AND/OR/NOT group is shown Expected: All nested child filters under top-level AND/OR/NOT group are totally shown. Note that persistent entries for all filters are actually existing in a .project file.
