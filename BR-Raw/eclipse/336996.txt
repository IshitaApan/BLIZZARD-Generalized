[Compatibility] Failures when calling IWorkbenchPage's openEditors(IEditorInput[], String[], int) method might not be reported

We currently only flag an error if the first editor could not be opened. This is obviously not correct. Any editor that could not be opened should immediately be flagged as being a problem.
