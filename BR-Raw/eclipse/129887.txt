"system settings have changed" dialog - why

I20060228-1207 - had a project, clicked 'Replace With...' > 'Another branch or revision' in the project's context menu - two (!) dialogs popped up over each other - one warning me about replacing locally changed resources (ok) - the second telling me that the system settings have changed and I needed to restart the workbench. No further explanation was given. This seems pretty harsh; if we really need to restart the workbench, we should explain some more! We should also explain the consequences of pressing the "No" button (don't restart). I have no idea why I suddenly need to restart. I didn't change any system settings AFAIK, so perhaps the problems is more that an event was sent out on the SWT side of it. Please dispatch as needed.
