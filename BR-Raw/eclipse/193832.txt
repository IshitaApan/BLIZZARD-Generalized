[ViewMgmt] ViewPart selection listeners don't work when perspective with secondary IDs first open

Build ID: I20070503-1400 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Extract and run included plugin 2. Open the "Test" perspective 3. Select one of the elements in "View 1", no output shows up 4. Close eclipse with the perspective active 5. Restart the runtime environment 6. Select one of the elements again, no output 7. close the perspective and re-open it, it now works More information: It looks like the first time the perspective is initialized the listeners don't work properly. If the view is closed and re-opened it all works. This is true if the view is first opened in Eclipse or if it was active the last time Eclipse ran and it activated for the first time when Eclipse restarts.
