[Forms] Last lines of lengthy context-sensitive help garbled

Build Identifier: I20100608-0911 For long context-sensitive (F1) help entries, where a scroll bar is displayed on the help window, if you scroll to the bottom of the window, the last two lines of context-sensitive help are often displayed on top of each other. Thus, the last two lines are unreadable. This problem is also dependent on the width of the help window. If you resize the help window horizontally to make it wider or narrower, the text will shift back and forth between being displayed correctly and incorrectly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open context-sensitive help that is so long that a scroll bar is displayed in the help window. 2. Scroll to the bottom of the help window. 3. Grab the control on the side of the help window and move it back and forth to make the window wider or narrower.
