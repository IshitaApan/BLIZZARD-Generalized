[DetachedView] No close box on shell of torn off views.

1) Drag any view out the content area of the shell that contained it. 2) Notice that the view is hosted in its own shell, which does not have a close box (but oddly *does* have a maximize button) Doing this on a Windows machine results in a shell with a close box (but no maximize button).
