[CSS] ETabFolder in CTabFolder mode top/bottom keylines differ

Created attachment 141705 Snap showing difference The top and bottom keylines of the ETabFolder, when in "webby: false" mode, no longer match. They're fine in webby mode. We may need to default them differently depending on the mode, or this may just get fixed by being able to specify them in CSS vs. current hard coded.
