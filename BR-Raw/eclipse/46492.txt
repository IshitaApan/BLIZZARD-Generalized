Explicit job manager startup/shutdown needed

IJobManager needs explicit API for startup and shutdown. The UI needs to be certain that all jobs are finished before the display is disposed. Otherwise, there is no possibility of giving feedback on jobs that are still running, and UI jobs may be run after the display is disposed. See bug 45294 for more details. Requirements: - Runtime plugin will start the JobManager as it does today - Explicit call to shutdown() will cancel all running jobs and put job manager in a state (running=false) where attempting to schedule new jobs would throw an exception - JobManager would have to be explicitly restarted it get out of "running==false" state. - Multiple calls to shutdown have no adverse affect - Runtime plugin will continue to manually perform job manager shutdown (in case application neglects to do it).
