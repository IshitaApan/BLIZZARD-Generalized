[CellEditors] [cell editors] TextCellEditor should not specify minimum size

Created attachment 129945 TextCellEditor.java.diff 3.5M6, but present since at least 3.3 TextCellEditor::getLayoutData overrides the default behavior inherited from CellEditor to - according to its javadoc comment - specify no minimum width, and returns a new LayoutData object. However, the default width set in LayoutData is 50, resulting in the cell editor being too wide for narrower columns. This leads to the cell editor extending into the next column if the edited column is narrower than 50 pixels. If the cell editor is SWT.RIGHT aligned, the text being edited appears over the next column. The solution is to really not specify a minimum width, i.e. to set override LayoutData's default and set it to 0. The attached patch does exactly that.
