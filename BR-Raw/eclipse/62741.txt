Activity to Activity binding API change

The IActivityActivityBinding specifies a binding between two activities where in order for one activity to be enabled and used it requires the enablement of another activity. The problem is that the current API is misleading in its naming and use of parent child relationships. So for example to specify (in XML) that plug-in development requires java development, you would do the following: <activityActivityBinding childActivityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment" parentActivityId="org.eclipse.plugInDevelopment"> </activityActivityBinding> clearly this is not what someone would assume they need to do, if anything the reverse. The proposal is that the XML look like this: <activityActivityBinding activityId="org.eclipse.plugInDevelopment" requiredActivityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"> </activityActivityBinding> and the Interface IActivityActivityBinding should be renamed IActivityRequirementBinding and be changed to: /******************************************************************************* * Copyright (c) 2000, 2003 IBM Corporation and others. * All rights reserved.
