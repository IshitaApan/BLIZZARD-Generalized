[LinkedResources][CommonNavigator] When to show "Files and Folders Operation" dialog on drop

Spawned from bug 301144. When will we show the new "Files and Folders Operation" dialog on drop? For many users (e.g. JDT and PDE users), the new functionality is most of the time not wanted, so we should not hijack the existing drop operation (which defaults to DROP_COPY). But as people from CDT explained, this seems to be different for CDT users. Here's a strategy that could satisfy both sides and solve the problem of the one-way "Don't ask again" checkbox: - DROP_COPY stays as in 3.5, i.e. don't show the dialog and always copy (never create links) - DROP_LINK shows the dialog - we add a new preference (e.g. in General > Workspace > Linked Resources), e.g. a checkbox "Dropping files and folders shows dialog to create links". If the preference is set, the default drop operation becomes DROP_LINK (and hence the dialog appears by default). - CDT-based products can initialize this new preference with "true", so their users get the dialog out-of-the-box - the dialog could offer a checkbox to toggle the preference (e.g. with label "Show this dialog by default when dropping files and folders") The current "Always perform the selected operation in this situation" checkbox is confusing, since: - it does not spell out what "situation" is affected - there's no way to get the dialog back - the default drop cursor is always DND.DROP_COPY even if the operation will create links If there is sufficient interest, you can work out a proposal to fix these 3 problems. Otherwise, the "Always perform..." checkbox must go away.
