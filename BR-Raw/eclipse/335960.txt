[IDE] Update BuildAction to use new Workspace Build Configurations API

Created attachment 188044 patch 1 The Workspace now supports building build configurations and their references. Currently BuildAction resolves project level references itself and builds the projects in turn. This patch updates BuildAction to delegate reference computation and building to the workspace which now has API for this. To do this I overrode WorkspaceAction's #runInBackground method. Other potential implementation that I tried didn't work: - Changing #invokeOperation -- this doesn't work as the method is invoked once per IResource - Overriding #createOperation -- doesn't directly produce a Job so can't mark the operation as belonging to the build family. #runInBackground is public API and callers expect it to run the BuildAction, so this seems to be the best place for this behaviour (e.g. CleanDialog calls this directly). Even though this is @noextend, there are some extenders (e.g. CDT). The patch preserves behaviour: shouldPerformResourcePruning() == true causes references to be built, shouldPerformResourcePruning() == false causes just the selected projects to be built.
