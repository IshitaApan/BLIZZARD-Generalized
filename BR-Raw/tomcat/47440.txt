Remove DB-specific SQL statements from test cases (SELECT 1)

Some of the test cases assume that the JDBC provider supports "SELECT 1" as a valid SQL statement; however this is not always the case, e.g. Derby requires a table name to select from. The solution provided in the patches is to use the validation query defined in the properties set up for the test, rather than always using "SELECT 1".
