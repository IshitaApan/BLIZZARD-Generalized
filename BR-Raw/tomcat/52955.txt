Add a ThreadFactory implementation to the ExecutorService used to deploy applications

Created attachment 28488 ThreadFactory implementation for ContainerBase ExecutorService The current implementation of the ExecutorService (in ContainerBase) uses the default thread factory, producing Threads named "pool-1-thread-1". Thread properties can be customised using a thread factory, modifying the naming scheme will help users identify container threads. Patch attached.
