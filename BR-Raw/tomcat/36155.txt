tomcat chooses wrong host if using mod_jk

Hi, my config is as follows: tomcat 5.5.9 knows two hosts, let's say the host "host1" and the host "host2". http://host1/ is basically a jsp-page echoing the string host1 - http://host2/ echos the string host2. apache 2.0.54 is configured with two vhost with ServerName host1 and host2. Both servers have a ServerAlias too - the one has ServerAlias alias1, the other has ServerAlias alias2 mod-jk 1.2.14 only knows one worker. My worker.properties looks like this: worker.list=worker1 worker.worker1.type=ajp13 worker.worker1.host=127.0.0.1 A very simple config. Both apache vhosts contain a "JkMount *.jsp worker1" Apache's UseCanonialName is on and Tomcats AJP-connector has useIPVHosts turned on. Therefor tomcat will chose the host by the server-name that mod_jk sends. So calling http://alias1/ results in a page containing the string host1, and calling http://alias2/ results in a page containing the string host2. The problem: Sometimes (not always and very selden) http://alias1 returns the string host2 and http://alias2 returns the string host1. I'm not sure, where the problem is, but i'm almost sure it's mod_jk - although i don't know, what should go wrong. I now defined a second worker with the same address and each of apache's vhosts use a different worker. The error didn't come up yet.
