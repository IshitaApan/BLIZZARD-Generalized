SSI regular expressions not working

I was trying to use Tomcat SSI filter: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssi-howto.html While it generally works, I have discovered that SSI regular expressions are not supported. As much as I can see from tomcat source code, this feature is just not implemented. For example, those expressions always return "did not match": <!--#if expr="abc = /abc/" -->matches<!--#else -->did not match<!--#endif --> <!--#if expr="abc = /[a-z]/" -->matches<!--#else -->did not match<!--#endif --> This bug is a showstopper for me, because in my application I need SSI regular expressions support.
