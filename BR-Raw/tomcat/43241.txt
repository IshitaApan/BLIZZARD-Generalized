ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()  does not follow API specs for Path

Say for example, you have a file style.css deployed in your context. The call to ServletContext.getResourceAsStream("style.css") returns an input stream. This is not correct behavior. The spec (2.3) says: > The path must be specified according to > the rules given in getResource. getResource() says: > The path must begin with a "/" and is interpreted > as relative to the current context root. My reading of these two things is that getResourceAsStream("style.css") should return null, not an input stream to the file. I got bit on this because my app behavior changed (broke) when ran on the current version of WebSphere.
