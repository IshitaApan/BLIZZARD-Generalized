Official schemes for WebSocket are "ws"/"wss"; WsWebSocketContainer only allows "http"/"https"

Created attachment 30056 Patch to address issue According to the WebSocket specification RFC6455 [1], the official URI schemes for the WebSocket protocol are "ws" and "wss." However, o.a.t.websocket.WsWebSocketContainer#connectToServer(...) throws an exception if anything other than "http" or "https" are specified. I agree with allowing "http" and "https" for reasons of friendliness (although the correctness of this could be debated; I did not address that in my patch), but "ws" and "wss" should ALWAYS be allowed here. Also, one should be allowed to specify a port for EITHER ws/http OR wss/https. However, the way it was written, you could only specify a port for ws/http, and wss/https always tried to use 443 (I understand that SSL wasn't fully implemented here yet). Imagine the scenario where Tomcat is running on 8080/8443. You would need to specify 8443 as the wss/https port. I have attached a patch that addresses these issues.
