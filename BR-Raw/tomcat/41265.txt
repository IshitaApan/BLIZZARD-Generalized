JspServlet's checkInterval parameter cannot be set to 0 implicitly

conf\web.xml's JspServlet init parameters include 'checkInterval', whose value is explained as follows: If development is false and checkInterval is greater than zero, background compilations are enabled. If I add the following parameters one would think the background compilations would be disabled (the value is not greater than zero). <init-param> <param-name>checkInterval</param-name> <param-value>0</param-value> </init-param> <init-param> <param-name>development</param-name> <param-value>false</param-value> </init-param> However, the value is changed to 300 and the following warning is outputted: Dec 30, 2006 7:13:57 PM org.apache.jasper.EmbeddedServletOptions <init> WARNING: Warning: Invalid value for the initParam checkInterval. Will use the default value of "300" seconds According to the comment in web.xml "0" was a valid value. Either the comment or the validity check is wrong. Or my understanding of them.
