IE plugins cannot access components through Tomcat 5 over SSL

SSL seems to be failing when the Content-Type header is set to "image/svg+xml". I've only seen this failure when SSL was running on a Solaris machine. (uname -a: SunOS [hostname removed] 5.8 Generic_108528-18 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60) When attempted on Windows, we were unable to duplicate the error. This reliably fails when attempted on this specific Solaris machine. If I get a chance, I'll try to create a test-case and see if I can reproduce this on other Solaris machines. Unfortunately, this was a show-stopper for a release that's being made today so I'm pressed for time. Basically, what happens is that we're using a JSP page to create an SVG file. Because of this, we have to set the Content-Type header to "image/svg+xml". When the MIME type is set to this value, the page fails to load in Internet Explorer 6 (SP1) with a message of "connection failed" or something similar. When an attempt was made in Opera, Opera responded by crashing. Mozilla successfully downloaded the file, though. However, when resetting the MIME type in the page to "text/plain" all three browsers can access the page without failure. By back-revving Tomcat to version 4.1.29, we were able to resolve this issue and access the page in all three browsers. I'll try and create a test-case later today and verify that it isn't just our SVG JSP that's failing but any that creates SVG but I'm currently pressed for time - sorry.
