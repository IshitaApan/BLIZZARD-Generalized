<Realm> without className in server.xml produces NullPointerException

If the className attribute is not included with the <Realm> tag in server.xml, the server dies with a cryptic NullPointerException. It would be nice if it produced a more meaningful error message (like "Missing className attribute for <Realm> tag").
