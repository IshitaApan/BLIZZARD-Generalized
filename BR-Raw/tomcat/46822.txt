Avoid redundant instantiations in StandardContext

Created attachment 23358 Patch file to replace new Booleans with primitive version While reviewing the source code, I noticed that java\org\apache\catalina\core\StandardContext.java code is creating Boolean objects unnecessarily. For example: support.firePropertyChange("antiJARLocking", new Boolean(oldAntiJARLocking), new Boolean(this.antiJARLocking)); is instantiating Boolean objects when there is already a version of firePropertyChange that accepts boolean primitives. So, the above can be rewritten to avoid instantiating new objects like: support.firePropertyChange("antiJARLocking", oldAntiJARLocking, this.antiJARLocking); This pattern was repeated for numerous properties. I took the liberty of creating a patch.
