[CVE-2013-2071] runtime exception in onComplete of AsyncListener, will make org.apache.catalina.connector.Request not recycled (orginally reported MESSAGE POST to tomcat, but it called doGet)

one HTTP request use POST method, but in tomcat it calls doGet() what is really strage. as I only tested in 7.0.23, and 7.0.32. in 7.0.32, 7.0.32 is more reproduceable than 7.0.23. I know it must be a very strange issue, as tomcat has so many release. I can't believe it if I didn't see it with my own eyes. so I attache the image.
