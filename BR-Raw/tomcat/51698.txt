ajp CPing/Forward-Request packet forgery, is a design decision? or a security vulnerability?

Created attachment 27416 ajp CPing packet forgery example because the ajp "Data" packet no "CodeType" and tomcat adopts lazy-reading strategy for reading ajp "Data" packet， (i.e., if you don't invoke request.getParameter("XXX")，tomcat does't read post request "Data" packet) so，the current "Data" packet keeping in the socket inputstream， the connection is keep-alive, ajp bio/nio procesor reading the next packet， this time, is "Data" packet。 if the first byte of "Data" packet'length is 0x02(Code Type of Forward Request Packet) or 0x0A(Code Type of CPing Packet)， then tomcat will be in trouble. please see the attachments. firt example: ajp CPing packet forgery example second example: ajp Forward-Request packet forgery
