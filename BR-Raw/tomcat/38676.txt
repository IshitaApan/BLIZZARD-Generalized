permanently reloading tagfile classes without changes to the tagfile

Scenario: - jsp with a tag in it (tagfile, no taglib) - activate "reloading" in web.xml - clean work directory - start tomcat - load jsp Tomcat generates/compiles/load the jsp and the tagfile classes. After "checkInterval" seconds the background compile thread "JspRuntimeContext[\*]" loads the tagfile classes (and only them) again and again. This produces a lot of work for the garbage collector. (permanently class unloading of tagfile classes) A Breakpoint in the method loadTagFile() in JspServletWrapper.java will show this. Perhaps the reload flag must be set to false after loading the TagFile? JspServletWrapper.java: ... if(reload) { tagHandlerClass = ctxt.load(); reload = false; //perhaps, this solves the problem but i am not shure } ... After restarting the server the problem is not present because no JspServletWrapper is instantiated for the tagfile an therefore the backround compile task does not check the tagfile.
