major error from minor whitespace error in properties file

A developer accidentally placed a tab character after the port number in the properties file for a tomcat instance. This prevented tomcat from listening on that port, but it was difficult to track down whether tomcat was running. Seems like the properties-file reader could easily trim excess whitespace before trying to use entries.
