Tomcat JarScanning does not work when Tomcat started with Java Web Start

Created attachment 30097 Patch to resolve issue As long as you correctly structure your JARs and call setParentClassLoader() with the current thread class loader on the Engine, Host, Server and Service, you can run Embedded Tomcat using Java Web Start. It's actually pretty neat. The only problem is that JarScanning doesn't work. In Java Web Start, all JAR URLs obtained from the class loader are the full http(s) URLs from where they were downloaded. Java has them cached locally, so accessing them is just as efficient because they're really coming from the local file system. However, the StandardJarScanner ignores JAR URLs that don't start with "file:" or "jndi:". This was an easy patch and everything else appears to still work normally. I propose that the patch be applied to trunk AND 7.0.
