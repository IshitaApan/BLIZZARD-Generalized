Implement the header X-Powered-By suggested by the servlet specification

Hello, The servlet 2.5 specification at http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr154/index2.html suggests in section "SRV.5.2 Headers" ... It is recommended that containers use the X-Powered-By HTTP header to publish its implementation information. The field value should consist of one or more implementation types, such as "Servlet/2.4". Optionally, the supplementary information of the container and the underlying Java platform can be added after the implementation type within parentheses. The container should be configurable to suppress this header. Hereâ€™s the examples of this header. X-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 X-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 JSP/2.0 (Tomcat/5.0 JRE/1.4.1) ... This behavior is not implemented in Tomcat 6.0.20. To make it totally clear, may I suggest to return the precise Tomcat and JVM version with all the digits and the vendor such as Tomcat/5.5.28 JRE/SUN/1.5.0_12-b04) Having this headers helps a lot the development team to determine what is really running his application in test or production w/o asking to the maintenance guy who is either often unreachable or not able to answer (YES). Provide the option to remove the header through the configuration (file) or through programming (see related bugs 48004 and 48005). The servlet 3.0 specification at http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/pfd/jsr315/index.html in the same section "SRV.5.2 Headers" says the same but I did not test for it in Tomcat 7. Thanks Olivier
