plus sign in url-pattern in servlet-mapping does not work

Hi all, I had servlet-mappings that contain plus signs (they were created by JspC), e.g.: <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>org.apache.jsp.suchergebnis_005fbu_002bbb_jsp</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/suchergebnis_bu+bb.jsp</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> This mapping does not work (the referred class is present)! When I change the original file names of the JSPs such that the plus signs are replaced by a minus signs the following mapping results: <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>org.apache.jsp.suchergebnis_005fbu_002dbb_jsp</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/suchergebnis_bu-bb.jsp</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> Now the mapping works. Therefore I assume that there is a bug in handling servlet mappings with plus signs in their url pattern.
