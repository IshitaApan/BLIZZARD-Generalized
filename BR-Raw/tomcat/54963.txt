Concurrent issue of Spdy/NetSupportSocket

Created attachment 30280 Patch for NetSupportSocket Duplicated Threads were started for doing "onBlockingSocket" in NetSupportSocket.java When a socket is coming, Listener creates a Runnable and executes the runnable with Thread Pool. In "onAccept", it invokes the method "onBlockingSocket". And the same method will be invoked in "ctx.getExecutor().execute(ch.inputThread);" as well. It means there are two threads work on one sinle Socket. This cause concurrent issue. Here is the orginal code, @Override public void onAccept(Object socket) { SpdyConnectionSocket ch = new SpdyConnectionSocket(ctx, (Socket) socket); ctx.getExecutor().execute(ch.inputThread); ch.onBlockingSocket(); } Just remove the line "ctx.getExecutor().execute(ch.inputThread);" will fix this issue.
