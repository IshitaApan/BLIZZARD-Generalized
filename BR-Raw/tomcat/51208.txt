SVN TRUNK : JDBC interceptor options are not taken into account

Created attachment 27013 Fix Hello, I added the following jdbcInterceptor: org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.interceptor.SlowQueryReportJmx(threshold=100, maxQueries=5000) But options are not taken into account, what happens is that options are applied to the N-1 interceptor due to the Hard positionning of TrapException. I provide the patch that fixes the issue. Regards Philippe Mouawad http://www.ubik-ingenierie.com
