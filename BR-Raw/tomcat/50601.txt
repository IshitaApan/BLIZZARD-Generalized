Redundant null checks before instanceof in equals()

Created attachment 26497 Patch to remove null checks There are several instances of the following code in equals methods: if (obj == null) return false; if (!(obj instanceof SomeClass)) return false; The null check is redundant, as null will fail the instanceof check.
