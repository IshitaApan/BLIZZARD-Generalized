NullPointerException in PooledConnection when username or password are null

I'm using jdbc-pool (version 1.0.8.5) to connect to a DataSource requiring no authentication. Unless I explicitly set the username and password in the PoolProperties object to empty String (as opposed to leaving them null), a NullPointerException is thrown on lines 215 or 216 of PooledConnection.connectUsingDriver().
