NamingContextListener fails to add itself as a PropertyChangeListener to all namingResources

Created attachment 24378 proposed fix In the NamingContextListener.lifecycleEvent(LifecycleEvent) method, the NamingContextListener object fails to add itself as a PropertyChangeListener to namingResources whose context is not a Server, e.g. a Context instance. This prevents the NamingResourcesMBean from working with non-Server contexts.
