Tomcat Server Side Includes (SSI) do not work with single quotes

In http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/en/mod/mod_include.html (apache 2.0 SSI documentation) you can read: "The value [of an attribute value] will often be enclosed in double quotes, but single quotes (') and backticks (`) are also possible." Tomcat SSI support is suposed to implement the same SSI directives as Apache. Unfortunately, it is not possible to enclose attribute values in single quotes. Thank you very much for reading this bug report.
