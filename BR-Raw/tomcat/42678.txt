docBase ignored even if its not a subdir of appBase

I use latest 6.0 SVN snapshot. I store deployable WARs in "webapps-dist" (aside "webapps"). This is my setup: bash-3.2$ ls $CATALINA_BASE conf logs temp tomcat-dist webapps webapps-dist work bash-3.2$ ls webapps-dist sample.war bash-3.2$ cat conf/Catalina/localhost/sample.xml <Context docBase="${catalina.base}/webapps-dist/sample.war"/> this ends up in: WARNUNG: A docBase /home/juergen/java/tomcat/webapps-dist/sample.war inside the host appBase has been specified, and will be ignored
