Add a validationQueryTimeout property

While it's possible to set the query timeout using the QueryTimeoutInterceptor, this will set the same timeout for all queries. It would be nice to be able to set an independent timeout for the validation query. In addition, DBCP supports this feature [1], so it would be nice to have this feature for compatibility / migration purposes. [1] - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DBCP-226 Thanks
