After session ID is changed on authentication, the session replication does not work.

After r889716, session ID is changed on authentication. (default of changeSessionIdOnAuthentication is true. ) But DeltaManager doesn't notify other cluster nodes. Therefore, non-primary node keeps having old session ID. And, can not replicate of change of session attribute notified by new session ID. The workaround is ... override changeSessionId method, and notify to change session ID. BackupManager is OK. This problem is DeltaManager only. Best regards.
