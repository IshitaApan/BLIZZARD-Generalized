CORS Filter

Created attachment 30363 A patch file containing CORS filter source code, units tests, and changes to tomcat documentation's filter.xml. CORS Filter implementation This is an enhancement request to include CORS Filter as one of Tomcat's container provided filters. CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a W3C specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that defines a mechanism to enable cross origin requests. This is a Java Servlet Filter implementation of server-side CORS. Here are few reasons that makes this implementation is a good fit: * Implements all required sections of the spec for servers. Handles simple/actual and pre-flight requests as per the specification. * Written specifically to fit well with Tomcat's source, and is formatted the same as Tomcat's source. * Filter implementation is just one class and is well Javadoc'd * Includes ample unit tests to validate the implementation against the spec * Simple to configure minimally and use * Easy to override default configuration, if required * Protects against CRLF injection / response splitting attacks. We(eBay) would like to contribute this implementation to Apache Software Foundation, to be included in Tomcat 8. And, I would also like to maintain and develop it, going forward. It's true that as a Servlet Filter, any webapp developer may add it to their app whether Tomcat includes it or not, but we believe that this is fundamental server behavior that should be present and easy to enable in the server, as it is in some other servers.
