Behaviour of ResourceBundleELResolver

I have discovered the the ResourceBundleELResolver from the tomcat el-api.jar behaves differently then the one from standard el-api. The difference lays in the handling of missing properties. The tomcat version will not set the resolved property to true such that evaluation continues and finally an exception is thrown. This causes pages to crash if a property can not be found (which I think is kind of unacceptable for production sites). The bahaviour was changed due to https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46915. I think that changing the standard behaviour of "resolving" an unbound property by just returning its key is to throwing an exception was a strong decision. I would strongly recommend of reintroducing the old bahviour and fixing the issue 46915 in a different way. If someone can point my to the requirements and corner cases related to 46915, I will gladly provide an implementation. Until then, a workaround for everybody using jsf: Subclass the ResourceBundleELResolver and override its getValue(...) method. Change it such that it sets the PropertyResolved attribute to true before any exception might occur. Register this custom resolver in the faces-config.xml with <el-resolver>
