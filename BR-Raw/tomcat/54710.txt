Java WebSocket specification says @OnMessage methods can have InputStream/Reader parameters; @OnClose can have CloseReason parameters

Created attachment 30057 Patch to address issue Title pretty much explains it all. The specification says that @OnMessage methods may have an InputStream parameter (and no boolean parameter) for binary messages, or a Reader parameter (and no boolean parameter) for text messages. However, the current implementation does not support that; an IllegalArgumentException is thrown when Tomcat processes the endpoint annotations. Also, the specification says that @OnClose methods may have a CloseReason parameter, but the current implementation does not support that. It was difficult for me to separate these issues, so I have combined them and the patch for them.
