Non-compliant annotations

A few of the annotations have compliance problem. javax.annotation.security.DenyAll @Target should only be METHOD javax.ejb.EJB missing description property javax.persistence.PersistenceContext missing properties property and associated PersistenceProperty annotation class The annotations can be verified by checking the JavaEE5 javadocs at http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/ docs/api/ I will post a patch to correct these problems.
