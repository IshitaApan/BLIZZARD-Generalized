Bug in WsServerContainer leading to NPE

Created attachment 30612 Patch showing fix The registerAuthenticatedSession method appears to have a bug. It looks like it's trying to find Set<WsSession> or create it if it is null. But the null check is against the input argument (wsSession) not against set of WsSession's. See attached patch.
