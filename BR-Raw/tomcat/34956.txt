Tomcat should enforce the requirements from servlet 2.4 specification SRV.8.2 SRV.8.2 Using a Request Dispatcher "To use a request dispatcher, a servlet calls either the include method or forward method of the RequestDispatcher interface. The parameters to these methods can be either the request and response arguments that were passed in via the service method of the Servlet interface, or instances of subclasses of the request and response wrapper classes that have been introduced for version 2.3 of the specification. In the latter case, the wrapper instances must wrap the request or response objects that the container passed into the service method. The Container Provider must ensure that the dispatch of the request to a target servlet occurs in the same thread of the same VM as the original request" Justification: ============== The absense of this enforcement leads to software beeing developed not following the specification. The software cannot be deployed later on a container which conforms to the above paragraph and hence must be changed before deployment. This somehow contradicts the idea of having a standards based infrastructure.
