RFE - MIME type extension not case sensitive

Hi, On the dev-tomcat list I described in the topic "Byte Serving and PDFs with the DefaultServlet" an issue that I had with Tomcat to serve PDFs. Analysing the answers I could find that the matter was related to the case of the file extension. Today Tomcat is case sensitive for MIME type extensions. So the solution for me was enter two MIME specifications on the web.xml file. One is for "pdf" and another one for "PDF". This way I would like to ask for and request for enhancement to make Tomcat be able to, due a setup on configuration file, consider or not case for MIME type extensions. Regards, Vitor
