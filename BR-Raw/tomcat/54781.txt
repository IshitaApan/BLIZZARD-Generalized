NPE in WsServerContainer if there is no matching path

Created attachment 30129 A proposed fix WsServerContainer.findMapping fails with a NullPointerException if there is no matching WsMappingResult. Also WsFilter needs a conditional clause to let the request through if there is no matching mapping. Attached is a patch.
