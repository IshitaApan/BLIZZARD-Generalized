URLTransfer is missing @since 3.4 tag

The org.eclipse.swt.dnd.URLTransfer class was made API in Eclipse 3.4 (bug 100095) but does not have an @since tag. Usage of the class can unintentionally break backwards compatibility. Please consider adding an @since 3.4 tag to the JavaDoc comment of the class.
