[StyledText] Surrogate -- cannot delete a complete surrogate character in java editor using backspace

Reporter: Huang Xing Jiang Language: Simplfied Chinese Build driver: eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.0M9 JDK Version: IBM JDK 1.41 Steps to recreate problem: 1.	Open a text file in the text editor 2.	Input a surrogate character \ud840\udc00 in the text file 	2.Try to delete character \ud840\udc00 using backspace <<Error>> Only half of the character was deleted. Another half appears as blank in the text editor, you can select the character using keyboard or mouse, but cannot see it <<Expected Result>> The whole surrogate character “\ud840\udc00” should be deleted <<Cause>> The text editor supposes that "Backspace" action will only delete "char" (16bit) in the editor, while surrogate character uses "two chars" (32 bit). <<Solution>> Modify "plugins\org.eclipse.swt\Eclipse SWT Custom Widgets\common\org\eclipse\swt\custom\StyledText.java" to take “Backspace” as a “string cluster” delete action
