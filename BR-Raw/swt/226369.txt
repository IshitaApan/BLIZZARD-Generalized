[Browser] Provide a way to know which rendering is used

Build ID: 3.4M6 We pilot the browser with Javascript so we need to know the rendering to take the differences into account. We can achieve this distinction with a mix of SWT.getPlatform() and browser.getStyle(). However, it would be much better to have a clear way to know the rendering, something like "Browser.getBrowserType()" which would return SWT.IE, SWT.MOZILLA, SWT.SAFARI, etc.
