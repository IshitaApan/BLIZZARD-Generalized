[SWT Examples] “Save As” Dialog of Image Analyzer does not provide the correct file path

When I tried to save an image by selecting “File -> Save As” from the main menu of the Image Analyzer application, the “Save As” dialog provided me with the following file path in the selection field: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2//alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png The correct file path should have been the following: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11. 2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip and install them. 3. Launch Eclipse 4. Select “Window -> Show View -> Other…”. This will launch the “Show View” Dialog. 5. From the “Show View” Dialog, select “SWT Examples -> SWT Example Launcher”. This will launch the “SWT Example Launcher” View. 6. In the “Examples” group, expand “Standalone” category, select “Image Analyzer” from the list and press “Run” button. This will launch the “Image Analyzer” application. 7. Open an image file and then attempt to save it by selecting “File - > Save As” from the main menu of the application. Expected Behavior: “Save As” dialog pops up. Its selection field should contain the correct file path. In my case, it should have been the following: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png Actual Behavior: The provided file path is invalid. In my attempt, the following was the file path it provided: /alfred2/home/swijenay/images2//alfred2/home/swijenay/images2/test.png
