Cant 'get' listener for CaretMoved

Build Identifier: M20110210-1200 I have a StyledText object. I want to check if I have already added a 'caretMoved' listener. However, the event type StyledText.CaretMoved is not public so I cannot access it and thus cannot check for it using styledText.getListners(). The event types in the StyledText need to be made public Reproducible: Always
