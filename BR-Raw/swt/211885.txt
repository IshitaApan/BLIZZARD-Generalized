ScrolledComposite control's setOrigin method not the same as moving scroll bar on Windows

Created attachment 84425 Snippet that illustrates the problem. Build ID: M20070921-1145 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Run the attached snippit on Windows. 2. Click the button in the upper-left-hand corner until the control animates to the right for the first time. (4 times on Windows Vista) 3. Without doing anything else try to move the horizontal scroll bars--all except the last are "frozen" in that they don't get the focus and one can't interact with them. Note that if you move the horizontal scroll bar or rezise the shell a little bit things are "un-frozen" More information: This bug is occuring in a more complex control than the snippet and is only on Windows. This problem does not occur on OS X or Linux. (Aside: On OS X I do see pixal corruption when tables are added into the scrolled composite and part of the table is off the screen--in this case table scrolling is done using the arrow keys with part of the table out of the cascading list's viewport.) I suspect that the ScrolledComposite control's setOrigin method is the root of the problem. Somehow it is not making the right native calls to do the same thing as a manual scroll bar movement. A workaround in the program (rather than via the mouse) would be very helpful to me. Best Regards...
