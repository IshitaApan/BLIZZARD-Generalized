[SWT Examples] CoolBar Buttons with a dropdown menu do not behave correctly

When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples- 3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip, I realized that the CoolBar buttons with a dropdown menu did not behave correctly. Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11. 2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip and install them. 3. Launch Eclipse 4. Select “Window -> Show View -> Other…”. This will launch the “Show View” Dialog. 5. From the “Show View” Dialog, select “SWT Examples -> SWT Controls”. This will display “SWT Controls” View. 6. From SWT Controls View, select “CoolBar” tab. 7. Chose a button with a dropdown menu. These buttons have a down arrow (\/) next to their icons. 8. Click on the down arrow (\/) of the button to extend its dropdown menu. Expected Behavior: The drop down menu is extended Actual Behavior: The drop down menu is not extended until the down arrow of the button ‘\/’ is clicked for the second time. Note: Do not select the items from the dropdown menu of the selected button. Important: When I ran the same tests on Eclipse 2.1.2, the outcome was the same as it was on Eclipse 3.0M7.
