Mnemonics give focus to the label on GTK

Build 2.0 release Linux/GTK For widgets that do not contain heder text, the mnemonic can be stored in a label adjacent to the widget. When such a mnemonic is triggered on GTK, keyboard focus is incorrectly being given to the label instead of the widget. To reproduce: 1) Open the Workbench->Editors preference page. 2) Press Alt+K to give keyboard focus to the Keybindings combobox - the combobox does not get hilighted 3) Press up/down to change the keybindings - nothing happens 4) Press Tab - the combobox gets hilighted 5) Press up/down - scrolls through the available options - the combobox has keyboard focus
