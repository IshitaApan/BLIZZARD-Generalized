Color javadoc could use reference to Device.getSystemColor()

It would be nice if the class description for the Color class would have a @see tag pointing the developer to Display.getSystemColor(). Most of the time I am creating "primary colors", and I never remember where to find them. I prefer to use the Display method since I don't have to dispose of the color, and it would be helpful if the Color class doc suggested this usage.
