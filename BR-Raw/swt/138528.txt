Tooltips do not show after tool button pressed

eclipse-SDK-N20060425-0010-win32 If you got to any view and click on a button, then hover over that button you will not see a tooltip until you have hovered over another button in the same view. This was first noticed in the cheat sheet view which has only one button on the toolbar and so the tooltip never gets restored
