Table Javadoc is conflicting with TableEditor

There seems to be a specification conflict between org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Table and org.eclipse.swt.custom.TableEditor. Table Javadoc states the following: "Note that although this class is a subclass of Composite, it does not make sense to add Control children to it, or set a layout on it." On the other hand, TableEditor Javadoc states: "The Control provided as the editor must be created with its parent being the Table control specified in the TableEditor constructor." If a Table implementation on a platform is done according to the Javadoc specification then it won't have the support required by TableEditor. Is there a problem with TableEditor or should all the platforms support adding Composite children to Table? In that case the Javadoc/spec has to be changed.
