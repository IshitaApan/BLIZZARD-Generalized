Color selection dialog takes a long time to display in 8-bit mode

Overview Description: The ‘color selection’ dialog takes up to 15 seconds to appear on Solaris, whereas, the dialog comes up almost instantaneously on HPUX. This behavior occurs on the first and subsequent color change requests. NOTE: It doesn’t seem to matter where you originate the color Selection request, the delay is the same (i.e. Color selection from The Preferences dialog takes the same amount of time as a color Selection request from the SWT Examples software / SWT Controls View. Steps to reproduce: 1.	Open the workbench Preferences dialog 2.	Select the ‘Java’ category, and open the ‘Editor’ preferences page 3.	Select the ‘Appearance’ tab 4.	Select the ‘Color’ button !BUG! There is a long wait time for the color selection dialog (the amount of time is a usability issue!) ------ Build 2002-11-07-1448 on Sparc/Solaris
