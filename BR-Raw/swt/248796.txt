[DND] Cannot drag and drop files between the Finder (ie. Cocoa and Carbon apps)

Just entering a bug based on Scott's comments so that it's not lost. Comments from Scott: At this point I’m aware of only one known problem. Cocoa apps don’t have a way to provide a list of files to the Finder using HFSFlavors like you have in Carbon. Instead, you place an NSArray of file names on the dragging clipboard with a flavor of NSFilenamesPboardType. Other Cocoa-based apps can understand that format, and I verified it works, but the Finder and other Carbon apps do not, so they don’t recognize the drag data. I don’t know what functionality is expected of FileTransfer across platforms, so I don’t know if the Carbon behavior was accidental or deliberate. Cocoa lets you do HFS promise file drags, but I don’t think that’s the same thing. I’ll do what I can to follow up with folks at Apple.
