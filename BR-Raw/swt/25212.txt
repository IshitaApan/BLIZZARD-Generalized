GPF synchronizing files with new Tree implementation

build 20021022 and later. The List, Tree and Table widgets have been reimplemented using the new GtkTreeView widget. By doing this we were able to close many out standing problems. There is a known GPF when running the new implementation with gtk2-2.0.2. The steps to reproduce it is to modify a file and synchronize its project with the repository. This GPF is a bug on GTK2 and it has been fixed in later versions. We are trying to workaround it, but we have not found a solution yet. Here is the GTK configuration that I have been running and that does not shows this problem: gtk2-2.0.5 glib2-2.0.4 pango-1.0.3 atk-1.0.1 freetype-2.1.2-7 another alternative configuration is: gtk2-2.0.5 glib2-2.0.4 pango-1.0.1 atk-1.0.1 freetype-2.0.9-2
