Please expose minHeight, minWidth, expandHorizontal, expandVertical in ScrolledComposite

For testing purposes I'm needing to retrieve the following attributes from ScrolledComposite: * minWidth * minHeight * expandHorizontal * expandVertical Can these please be exposed? I think I can get around them not being visible but it would be easier if I could just call a method.
