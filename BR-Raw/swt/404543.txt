[Win 8] Internal WebBrowser fails to detect IEVersion 10 and incorrectly operates in IE9 compatibility mode only

I have a web page compatible with IE10 but not IE9. In the external browser it is displaying ok, in the internal Eclipse browser the rendering fails. I found that the cause of this is, that IE9 compatibility mode is enabled in the Eclipse internal browser. The reason for this is that SWT fails to detect IE10 correctly. The code in the static initializer of org.eclipse.swt.browser.IE reads HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Version, which is 9.10.9200.16453 on my machine although I'm on Windows 8, 64-bit with Internet Explorer 10 installed. There is an svcVersion property as well, which is set to 10.0.9200.16466. As a workaround I added the following line to eclipse.ini to force the IEVersion value: -Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.IEVersion=10000 This works for me, but it'd be nice to have this fixed. Best regards...
