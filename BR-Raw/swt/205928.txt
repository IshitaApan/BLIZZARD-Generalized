underline text style needs clarification

I20071009-0800. The Javadoc of the old 'underline' and the new 'underlineStyle' need clarification: how do they relate to each other? - does 'underline' need to be true if 'underlineStyle' is set? - what style is used if only 'underline' is true but no style provided? I suggest that - 'underline' must be set to 'true' in order to get text underlined - the default style is spec'ed to be 'UNDERLINE_SINGLE'
