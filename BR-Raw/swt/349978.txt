need Accessible.sendEvent(int event, Object eventData, int childID)

Build Identifier: SWT v3659c We have our own version of ToolBar control. It is not OS native based. It draws the UI by itself. To support accessibility, we do the same thing as initAccessible() in SWT CTabFolder. So like CTabFolder, we have only 1 accessibility object in our version of ToolBar. Now we want to support various Accessibility events, so that JAWS can receive the events, then change the accessibility properties. The problem is currently SWT provides only Accessible.sendEvent(int event, Object eventData). It does not allow us to specify childID. To do that, we know we need to instantiate Accessible object by calling constructor Accessible(Accessible parent), but actually we implemented only 1 Accessibile object (and not creating Accessible(Accesssible parent)). So we don't want to rewrite our current accessibility code. So, we would like to propose SWT to have: Accessible.sendEvent(int event, Object eventData, int childID) Reproducible: Always
