Confusing GridData javadoc

GridData class docs sez: " * </pre> * The second is to take advantage of convenience style bits defined * by <code>GridData</code>: * <pre> * button1.setLayoutData(new GridData(GridData.HORIZONTAL_ALIGN_FILL | GridData.GRAB_HORIZONTAL)); * </pre> * </p> * <p>" But when you look at docs for those styles, we have: 	 * Not recommended. Use 	 * <code>new GridData(SWT.FILL, int, boolean, boolean)</code> 	 * instead. 	 */ 	public static final int HORIZONTAL_ALIGN_FILL = 1 << 8; 	 * Not recommended. Use 	 * <code>new GridData(int, int, true, boolean)</code> 	 * instead. 	 */ 	public static final int GRAB_HORIZONTAL = 1 << 9; Why are we using as an example something that isn't recommended?
