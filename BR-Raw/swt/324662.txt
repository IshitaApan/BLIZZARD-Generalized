[Mac] Hand cursor does not appear on Link

Created attachment 178331 Plugin to reproduce The problem looks weird to me. I have a view that displays a link. If my application is launched with the view already present in the workbench, then the hand cursor does not appear on the link after the couple of editors are switched. Steps to reproduce : 1) Please find the attached plug-in - self host the eclipse using this view. 2) Make sure the view is present when the eclipse is launched (next time). 3) Hand cursor appears on the link at this moment. 4) Create 2 Java files - switch between them. 5) The hand cursor does not appear on the links :( Note: The problem goes away if the view is closed and restarted. Also, the problem occurs only when the view is loaded along with the workbench. On Cocoa, we set the offsets required for displaying the hand cursor to the platform. This is not clear why the hand cursor is not appearing after the editors are switched.
