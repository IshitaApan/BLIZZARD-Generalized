[SWT Examples] Image Analyzer crashed when tried to save images as PNGs and ICOs

On Solaris 9 and HP-UX 11i, Image Analyzer (an SWT Example) crashed when I tried to save images in the following formats: PNG and ICO. Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11. 2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip and install them. 3. Launch Eclipse 4. Select “Window -> Show View -> Other…”. This will launch the “Show View” Dialog. 5. From the “Show View” Dialog, select “SWT Examples -> SWT Example Launcher”. This will launch the “SWT Example Launcher” View. 6. In the “Examples” group, expand “Standalone” category, select “Image Analyzer” from the list and press “Run” button. This will launch the “Image Analyzer” application. 7. Open the attached image file “ACT_RS.PNG” by selecting “File - > Open” from the main menu of the application. 8. Attempt to save file “ACT_RS.PNG” as “modified.png” by selecting “File - > Save As” from the main menu of the application. Actual Behavior: Eclipse workbench displays an error message.
