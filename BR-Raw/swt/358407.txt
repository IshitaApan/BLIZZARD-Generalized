Clarify Javadoc for DND#DROP_MOVE

Follow-up to bug 30543 et al. The Javadoc for DND#DROP_MOVE should tell explicitly who is responsible for which actions (similar to DROP_TARGET_MOVE). Here's my suggestion, which also includes a very important warning about potential data loss: /** * Drag and Drop Operation: a copy of the data is added to the drop target and * the drag source removes the original data and any references to the data, * and updates its display (value is 1 &lt;&lt; 1). * <p> * <b>Warning:</b> Some applications (most notably the Mozilla suite) return * {@link DND#DROP_MOVE} even if they just open the file and don't copy * anything, see * <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=30543">bug 30543</a>. * To avoid data loss, you may want to not remove the original data * when you handle a {@link DND#DragEnd} for a {@link FileTransfer} whose * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Event#detail} is {@link #DROP_MOVE}. * </p> */ public final static int DROP_MOVE = 1 << 1;
