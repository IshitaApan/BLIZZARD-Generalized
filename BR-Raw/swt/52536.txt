[SWT Examples] Setting the style to SWT.FLAT has no effect on Buttons

When I was going through the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples- 3.0M7.zip) which I downloaded from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip on Solaris 9 and HP-UX 11.11, I realized that setting the style of a Button to SWT.FLAT had no effect on its appearance on the screen. Here are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario: 1. Install Eclipse 3.0M7 on Solaris 9 or HP_UX 11.11. 2. Download Eclipse 3.0 M7 Examples (eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip) from http://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse- examples-3.0M7.zip and install them. 3. Launch Eclipse 4. Select “Window -> Show View -> Other…”. This will launch the “Show View” Dialog. 5. From the “Show View” Dialog, select “SWT Examples -> SWT Controls”. This will display “SWT Controls” View. 6. From SWT Controls View, select “Button” tab. 7. In the “Styles” group, make sure SWT.FLAT option is unchecked and SWT.PUSH is checked. Expected Behavior: The Buttons look similar to the image “flat_unchecked_on_3.0M7.jpg” 8. Check option SWT.FLAT in the “Styles” group. Expected Behavior: The Buttons should look similar to the image “flat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg” Important: “flat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg” shows the appearance of the Buttons when SWT.FLAT is applied on the Eclipse 2.1.2 examples on the Eclipse 2.1.2 workbench. Actual Behavior: The appearance of the Buttons does not change. They still appear the same way they did before SWT.FLAT was applied. See image flat_checked_on_3.0M7.jpg Important: When I ran the same tests on the Examples of Eclipse 2.1.2 on the Eclipse 2.1.2 workbench, the effect of setting SWT.FLAT on Buttons was visible. A snapshot of the appearance of Buttons is shown in figure “flat_checked_on_2.1.2.jpg”. However, when it comes to Eclipse 3.0M7, SWT.FLAT option seems to have no effect on Buttons.
