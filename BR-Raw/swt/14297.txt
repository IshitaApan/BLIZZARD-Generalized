Add a Spinner widget to the SWT toolkit

One widget I am surpised is not in the standard set of SWT widgets is a Spinner. I'm sure you know what a spinner is, but to be absolutely clear, I am referring to a widget with a text area and two buttons (usually with up and down arrows), that is designed to allow easy input of (usually) numeric values, or to iterate over an ordered list. Spinners are certainly very common on Windows (I don't know if they are native widgets or not), and are a common enough GUI concept to have made it into Swing (as of JDK1.4 - javax.swing.JSpinner). It would be useful if SWT provided an implementation of a Spinner - at the very least one that operates on numeric values, although the ability to handle times and dates would be nice as well.
