Toolbar computeSize stop working after WM_SETFONT

Our editor has a problem when turning on and off a combo box on toolbar. Once users encounter this problem, they have to reset toolbars and restart workbench to fix it. Steps to reproduce: 1. Start run-time workbench with attached plugin 2. Create a simple project 3. Create a file named 'test.w'. Make sure that two toolbar items, a button and a combo box, are added to toolbar. 4. Click the button item on toolbar twice. Make sure that the combo box turns off by the first click and turn on correctly by the second click. 5. Show Windows display properties and change desktop background color. 6. Retry step 4 !!! The combo box gets narrow by the second click. It happens not only on changing system settings but also on Windows returning from stand-by or display-lock. So, it happens frequently. Build 2003-06-04 on Windows XP
