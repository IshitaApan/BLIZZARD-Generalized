Emulated CCombo vs. native Combo

It seems that on WIndows the non-native CCombo is preferred over the native Combo. This results in severe usability problems on Mac OS X because the CCombo suffers from the following defects: - the drop down menu takes focus which deactivates the main window and clears the menu bar. Both operations make the menu so slow that it is almost unusable (see bug #46962). - the drop down menu shows a focus ring, which is just wrong. - the look of the CCombo does not resemble the native Mac Combo (see attached screenshots). Since the native Combo does not have these problems (and because I cannot see a single reason why the emulated CCombo is preferred over the native Combo), we should consider to implement the CCombo on Mac by using the native Combo. This would be much easier than fixing the defects of the CCombo.
