"Can shrink" property does not work for HTML

Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create Grid element with 3 columns and 1 row in empty report 2. Make "width" property of Grid empty 3. Set "Can shrink" to true 4. Put label in each cell of grid 5. Enter "aaaa", "aaaaaaaa", "aaaaaaaaaaaa" values in corresponded label 6. Swich to preview - the grid has 100% width and output look like: aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa | but should aaaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaa| The same incorrect behavior for table item. It is regression because it worked in 2.1.1 More information: HTML emmiter always produce <table cellpadding="0" style=" border-collapse: collapse; empty-cells: show; width:100%;"> in spite of width is empty. Probably "Can shrink" property should do somethink else but there is not description of it in help. In any case if "width" property is empty HTML emmiter should not set 100% width.
