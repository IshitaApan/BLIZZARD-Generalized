Classloader deadlock related to org.eclipse.birt.core.framework.osgi.OSGILauncher$ChildFirstURLClassLoader

Created attachment 144999 Listing of classloader deadlocks while using BIRT engine API Build ID: M20090211-1700 Steps To Reproduce: I can reliably reproduce this by running a data import thread that opens a lot of files (~800) in a loop via URL.openStream() while attempting to initialize a BIRT report engine in another thread. Attached is a thread dump with this information. Refer to the classloader-deadlock.txt file and search for the deadlock which contains the "StaticKeyDataConfig" thread. More information: I'm running BIRT 2.3.2 and getting frequent deadlocks of which org.eclipse.birt.core.framework.osgi.OSGILauncher$ChildFirstURLClassLoader plays a part. Attached are some thread dumps. The first one is the webapp running under Tomcat and the second is the webapp running under Jetty. The third thread dump occurred after changing the parent class loader to Object.class.getClassLoader() via the EngineConstants.APPCONTEXT_CLASSLOADER_KEY property in the app context and this dump doesn't include OSGILauncher$ChildFirstURLClassLoader. If anyone knows of any workarounds, please let me know. Thanks.
