HTMLRenderOption.setEmbeddable(true) incorrectly includes CSS classes in BIRT 2.3.1

Created attachment 123127 all of the test files and resulting output for this bug report In BIRT 2.3.1, it seems that HTMLRenderOption.setEmbeddable(boolean) no longer works as it did under BIRT 2.2.1. The setEmbeddable(true) method adds HTMLType=HTMLNoCSS to the list of options, which is expected behavior. However, under BIRT 2.2.1 this setting would inline the styles for each HTML element, rather than using CSS classes. Under BIRT 2.3.1, a Style tag is added with CSS classes even if I call HTMLRenderOption.setEmbeddable(true). Not only that, but the element that I applied the style to still references the CSS style with a class attribute. Included as an attachemnt is a zip archive called sumbission.zip. It contains two Java classes (based on BIRT sample code) I used to generate test output. The test.java targeted BIRT 2.3.1 and test2.java targeted BIRT 2.2.1. I would run the code with setEmbeddable(true) and again with setEmbeddable(false). This resulted in the following output files: BIRT2.3.1-embeddableTRUE.html BIRT2.3.1-embeddableFALSE.html BIRT2.2.1-embeddableTRUE.html BIRT2.2.1-embeddableFALSE.html The names indicate the version and boolean flag used for the setEmbeddable() method call. I also included the report design files I used and a dummy text file to run the reports against called names.txt. I created the same basic report using BIRT Designer 2.2.1 and again with 2.3.1 just to make sure each version was running its own "native" rptdesign file. This is why there are two rptdesign files included. At any rate, if you do a diff between the output HTML between versions you will see how the style tag and class attributes are inappropriately used when setEmbeddable(true) was used.
