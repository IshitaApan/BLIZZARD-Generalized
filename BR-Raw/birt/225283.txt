Column header should not be affected if the first row matches the map/highlight condition.

Created attachment 94504 screenshot description: Column header should not be affected if the first row matches the map/highlight condition. build id: 2.3.0 v20080402-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a datasource with sample db and new a dataset with table customers.(filter: customernumber<131) 2. New a cube, define customername and customernumber as dimensios, define creditlimit as measure. 3. New a crosstab, drag customernumber to row area, drag customername to column area, drag creditlimit to detail area. 4. Add a map/hight rule like:data["CUSTOMENUMBER"] Equal to 103. 5. Preview. Expected result: Only the row with a customernumber 103 will be highlighted/mapped. Actual result: The column header is also hightlighted/mapped.Please see attached scrrenshot. I think this is not correct.
