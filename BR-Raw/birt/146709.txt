Dates still do not work from main report to sub reports...

Hello, This is a follow-on to bug 136953. 136953 was closed as resolved... But... It still fails (at least for me)... And for me it's still a blocker... So... here's what I've done... * Start from scratch with: birt-report-designer-all-in-one-N20060612 * Build 2 reports... one calling the other as a "Drill-Through"... both using the default "built-in" database... Pass a date from the first to the second... as a parameter... to date selected data in the second report. I get (in the popped HTML browser... trying to show the 2nd report: The value "Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 CST 2005" is invalid with the type "dateTime". I'll attach the files used to this bug... once submitted so you should have a complete test case. Thanks, Gary
