Created attachment 98904 Query window that appears when I am running my mock translation Build ID: I20080502 Steps To Reproduce: 1. File > New > Other > Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools-> Report Project and click Next. 2. Give any project name 3. File > New > Report 4. Right click data source > New Data Source 5. On Select Data Source Type, select the Classic Models Inc. Sample database, click Next and click Finish. 6. Right click Data Set 7. Click on the New Data Set 8. Click Next More information: I am running a build of eclipse that takes into account of translations and string externalization. When I go through these steps without the translation running, the steps go through fine. However, if I go through these steps with the translation running, I get an error that says: "The Data Source 'Data Source' used by this data set was created using an older version of this product. Its definitions need to be updated. Choose 'OK' to update data source 'Data Source' now. You will then need to reopen this dataset editor. Once I click Finish in the window, I then get the following error: Failed to prepare the following query for the data set type org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.JdbcSelectDataSet. Error Preparing SQL statement SQL error #1 Syntax error: Encountered "<EOF>" at line 1, column 0.
