Execution of sample crosstab in 2.5.1 is 10 times slower than 2.5.0

Created attachment 144787 report design Description: 1, Open CrosstabSampleRevenue.rptdesign in Report Examples-> Cross tab 2, Compare the execution time between 2.5.0 and 2.5.1 The execution time in 2.5.0 is less than 3 seconds but in 2.5.1 the execution time is more than 30 seconds. The difference is obvious. For further testing, I remove unused levels for example month, day, hour and etc. The execution is faster. But in 2.5.0 the unused levels will not take effect the execution speed.
