Assertions being thrown in org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.layout.html.HTMLAbstractLM.execute

Created attachment 92507 Stack Trace I deployed the WebViewerExample to BEA Weblogic server and added simple reports to the report folder that are using data sources and datasets being displayed using a Table. When running the report using the /frameset method in the url it resulted in the attached stack trace. After looking at the cvs source a bit I was able to determine that org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.layout.html.HTMLAbstractLM.execute has a codepath where it calls "execute( childContent, childExecutor );" where the childContent can be null which causes an assertion to be thrown. I've been able to verify that you can consistently replicate the problem by creating a Birt report containing a Table that has the "Page Break" properties with "Repeat Header" checked. It will result in this assertion being thrown. BEA Weblogic server on my development machine defaultly enables java assertions with the -ea flag. I was able to workaround this issue by setting -da:org.eclipse.birt... to disable birt assertions.
