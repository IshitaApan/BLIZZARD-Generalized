IDataSetInstance.getInputParameters() method returns Map which does not guarantee the order

Build ID: I20080330-1350 Birt Version: 2.3 M6 All-In-One. Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a scripted dataset and add some parameters to it. Call them StartDate, EndDate, HelpParam etc. 2. in the Open method of a java event handler call the getInputParameters() method of the dataset and get the map that is returned. 3. Iterate through the Map and notice that the parameters will be sorted by name rather then retain the order in which they were created More information: This may be by design but there are valid reasons to maintain the order of the parameters as created. For instance if the Java EventHandler code depends on the order in order to use reflection to look up a method signature on an underlying POJO. Because the Map interface and underlying Map implementations do not guarantee preservation of the creation order maybe this method should return a List of parameter objects instead.
