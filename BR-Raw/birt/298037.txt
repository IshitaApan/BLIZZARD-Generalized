[Regression] Date and time parameter did not show correct value if use a computed column with aggregation [0705]

Created attachment 154637 report design Description: Date and time parameter did not show correct value if use a computed column with aggregation BuildId: 2.5.2.v20091216-1500 Steps to reproduce: 1. New a dataset with a datetime column, row["date time"] 2. Add a computed column "date", type Date, Expression: row["date time"] 3. Add a computed column "time", type Time, Expression: row["date time"], Aggreation: Max 4. Preview the dataset, column "date" and "time" display the correct value 5. New a report parameter, type: Time, display type: Combobox, Static 6. Click "Import Values", choose column "time" Check the value. Expected result: The listed time value should be same as in dataset preview Actual result: The listed time value is "2005-05-31 00:00:00.000", not the same as dataset preview. If I remove the aggregation on the computed column, it works fine.
