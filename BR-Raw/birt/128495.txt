Provides BIRT Adapter of DTP Oda Design objects to/from ROM ODA Data Handles

As part of migrating BIRT 2.1 to adopt the DTP ODA Design-time framework, a DTP ODA designer (such as those contributed by the ODA XML and JDBC plugins) will no longer update the ROM ODA data handles directly. Instead, a DTP ODA designer will consume and update the ODA-defined data access design objects ( the DataSourceDesign and DataSetDesign interfaces in the org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda.design plugin). BIRT, being an ODA host application, will then need to adapt from/to the ODA design objects into the ROM OdaDataSourceHandle and OdaDataSetHandle objects, which are then stored in the report design. The BIRT report designer's Data Source/Set Wizard/Editor will be the direct consumer of this ROM-ODA adapter. I'd suggest add a new plugin to serve as this ROM-ODA adapter, which will have dependency on both the report.model and oda.design plugins. This way, the report.model project itself does not have direct dependency on oda. Side note re: working with the oda.design interfaces. These interfaces are EMF model based. One should use the oda.design.DesignFactory.eInstance.createXX methods to instantiate the oda.design implementation objects (EObject). In addition, EMF provides an utility class EcoreUtil, which is quite useful in doing deep copy or other common EObject operations on these oda.design EMF objects. See the EMF Javadoc in: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/2.2.0/javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/ecore/util/EcoreUtil.html
