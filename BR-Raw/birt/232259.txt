Performance poor if Property Editor is open.

Build ID: v20070924-0630 Steps To Reproduce: 1.Open Report & Property Editor 2.Select an item in the report -> the refresh of the property editor takes a lot of time (some seconds). In this time it is not possible to work because the selection in the report is done after the property editor has been refreshed. 3.Select a different item... More information: The problem only occures if different items are selected one after another which results in a refresh of the property editor. If the property editor view is closed the selection in the report works fine. The problem occures since the 'new' property editor (v2.2.x) has been added. In v2.3 RC0 the problem is still reproduceable. It is hardly possible to work with this performance.
