Bad expression error is not reported in the attached report

Created attachment 104241 report design Preview the attached report design in Report Designer. A blank table is displayed, with no error message. If you look at the definition of the binding CurrentYearSales however, it contains an invalid function reference: dataSetRow["orderDate"].getYear_bad() If you add a data item to the detail row of the table that displays the value of CurrentYearSales, Report Preview correctly displays an error message for the Javascript expression error. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: previewing the attached report should result in an error, same as if the invalid binding is referenced in the detail row. BUILD TESTED: 2.3.0v20080527
