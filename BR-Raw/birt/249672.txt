Hiding a label on a table header conditionally does not work in PDF output correctly

Created attachment 114248 sample report design to illustrate the problem. A report having a table header that contains multiple Lable fileds having a conditional hideelement flag does not work as expected in PDF output format. Alternating pages contain all the labels and it seems like the condition is not getting evaluated on these alternate page renderings. I am attaching a sample report that illustrates the problem. We share a single report across multiple applications and show or hide a given label based on some parameter. Beacuse of this issue, the report output looks very bad. This used to work fine in BIRT 2.1.2 and seems to be introduced in 2.3. I have tried the 2.3.1 release and the problem still exists.
