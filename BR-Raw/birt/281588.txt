getRowData().getColumnValue(...) returns null starting second page when a dataset is bound to the master page

Created attachment 140165 dummy report demonstrating problem (uses classicmodels sample db) Trying to access this.getRowData.getColumnValue(...) in the onRender event of a header row in table returns null starting the second page of a report when exporting to, or printing to, pdf from the web viewer. This only occurs if a data set is bound on the master page as well. (If you 'view in pdf' from within the report designed all appears to work fine.) To reproduce - Create a data set with a group that produces multiple group (with detail lines) - Set the group to Page Break before setting to 'Always Excluding First' - In the group header 'onRender' event add following code expression: Packages.java.lang.System.out.println("Customer name = " + this.getRowData().getColumnValue("CUSTOMERNAME")); (with "CUSTOMERNAME" a column in your data set) - Create a second data set that returns exactly 1 row of data - On the master page add a dynamic text element and bind this second dataset to the dynamic text and output use the value in the expression. - View the report in the web viewer - For each page in the report you should see following printed on the command line similar to: "Customer name = Signal Gift Stores" as you browse from page to page (For every page access the current value in the dataset is printed to stdout - make sure to launch birt with console to see this.) - Now either Export to pdf from the viewer, or print the report from the viewer --> only the first page's customer name is printed to stdout, for all other pages you'll get: "Customer name = null" Attached sample report demonstrates the above (don't look at the visible report, that's all just for show. The real error/problem is printed to stdout) Notes (recap): - Problem does not occur when using 'view in pdf' directly from the BIRT report designer - Problem does not occur when there's no dataset bound on the master page - Problem does not occur in (html) report viewer. - In my actual report a value is printed to stdout for the first page (only) in a multi-page export/print to pdf. The attached dummy report that reproduces this problem doesn't print a value for the first page either with BIRT 2.3.0 (In BIRT 2.5.0 the first page's output does get printed.) Problem can be reproduced (using same attached report) with BIRT 2.3.2(.2) & BIRT 2.5.0
