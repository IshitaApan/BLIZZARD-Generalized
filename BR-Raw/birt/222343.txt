A modeless dialog with a parent modal dialg isn't receiving any events and can't be used  in linux

As the fix of #117580, I think it still exists problem, when I ran the test case provided by Billy Biggs in comment#1 of #117580, the modal parent dialog can receive events, but the inner modeless dialog can't receive any events. It blocks an issue #194376, it is the root reason of #194376. I think the correct logic should be: If the inner dialog is modeless, both of the inner modeless dialog and its parent modal dialog could receive events and can be used. If the inner dialog is modal, only the inner modal dialog and its children can receive events and can be used. it should be same with windows. The Billy's test case shows below and I ran it against eclipse3.4M5 and ubuntu linux 6.1. public static void main(String[] args) { Display display = new Display(); Shell shell = new Shell(display); shell.setLayout(new FillLayout()); Button button = new Button (shell, SWT.NONE); button.setText("This is the main root dialog"); shell.pack(); shell.open(); Shell dialog1 = new Shell(shell, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM | SWT.APPLICATION_MODAL); dialog1.setLayout(new FillLayout()); button = new Button(dialog1, SWT.NONE); button.setText("This is dialog #1"); dialog1.pack(); dialog1.open(); Shell dialog2 = new Shell(dialog1, SWT.DIALOG_TRIM | SWT.MODELESS); dialog2.setLayout(new FillLayout()); button = new Button(dialog2, SWT.NONE); button.setText("This is dialog #2"); dialog2.pack(); dialog2.open(); while (!shell.isDisposed()) { if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep(); } display.dispose(); } Thanks.
