X-Axis as value axis has extra value before min and after max value.

Created attachment 117616 Snapshot of a graph with markings showing the problem Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a report with a dataset of +- 300 records and two columns. The first column containing date-time values, one per hour for each day, ordered by date-time. Add a second column containing numbers to the dataset. This problem also occurs with X-axis containing numbers. 2. Create a line or area chart to display this data. X-Axis is the date-time column from the dataset and Y-axis is the number column. Size is 500px high, 900px wide. 3. On "format chart", clear tick on "Is Category Axis". Note the preview already shows the problem. 4. Preview the chart. More information: Problems: 1. Two extra X-values are added to the X-axis. One is added to the left of the X-axis that is one grid step size less than the minimum in the dataset. Another is added to the right of the X-axis that is one grid step size more than the maximum in the dataset. By grid step size I mean the number or date difference between each X-axis label. This makes the graph unecessarily large. The scale of the chart is set to auto and min and max are blank. This should use the minimum and maximum of the dataset and these should be the first and last points on the chart. If the current method "looks nice", then it should rather be an option. See snapshot attached, markers B and C. Note, in the snapshot, the minimum date value is "2008-08-04 16:00" and the maximum is "2008-08-16 16:00". On graph, the minimum of the graph is "2008-08-04 14:00" and the maximum is "2008-08-16 18:00".
