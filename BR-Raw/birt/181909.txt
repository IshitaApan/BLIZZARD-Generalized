BIDI3.3:HCG_Mixed BiDi and Latin text are not correctly reordered in PDF report

This is a BiDi specific defect. Please use BiDi chars instead of capital Latin letters in the examples below. Setup: ------ 1. Follow up the instructions provided at http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/build/ and copy itext-1.3.jar and iTextAsian.jar files into plugins/com.lowagie.itext_*/lib directory. 2. Set default OS locale to Hebrew 3. Run Eclipse without any command line parameters. Steps to reproduce the defect ------------------------------ 1. Create Report Project 2. Create empty report template 3. Add labels with BiDi text to report template. Use following text: HELLO 123 world hello WORLD FRIEND 123 abc 4. Preview the report in PDF viewer 5. Notice how text appear Expected result: 123OLLEH world hello 123 DNEIRF DLROW abc Actual result: OLLEH321 dlrow hello DNEIRF DLROW 321 abc PDF viewer supports visual display (as opposed to logical display in Notepad and MS Word), thus it is necessary to apply BiDi transformation on the text before it is passed to PDF viewer for rendering. Unfortunately in this case BiDi transformation applied on the text produces incorrect result and thus does not conform to Unicode BiDi algorithm http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/.
