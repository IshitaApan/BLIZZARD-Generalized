Insert a label and a cross tab. Add page break before/always to the cross tab. Preview now and the cross tab is displayed on the second page. 2. New a boolean type parameter and use it as visibility expression of the cross tab. In my case, check the box to display the cross tab. 3. Preview the report and check the box.
