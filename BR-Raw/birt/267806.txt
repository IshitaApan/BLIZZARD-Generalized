BIRT -  facing an issue when Data Cube uses Scripted Data Set

Created attachment 128165 This attachment shows the alerts in console which also show the order in which components in layout gets executed. Hi, I am facing an issue when a data cube uses scripted data set. It looks like the scripted data cube is getting loaded first (even before the required tables are loaded). Please find my scenario 1. I have a Data Set , there are scripts in events "before close","before open" & "onfetch" to collect data as array of objects ( and stored in a Global Variable). 2. I have a Scripted Data Set, there are scripts in events "open" & "fetch" to get the data as array of objects (from the Global Variable) & do some manipulation and show only the required data. 3. In the report layout when i create two tables with data set & scripted data set its working fine. But when i added a Data Cube (associated with Scripted data set) then cross tab is not able to access the value from global variable (since cross tab is getting loaded first)... (is it possible to load tables first and then cross tab ?) The attachment shows the order of execution of the components in the report layout Thanks, Vijay
