Use of Resource Locator to look up resource defined in a JS Expression

An application that embeds the BIRT engine can provide a resource locator to take care of all its resource lookup, especially since there can only be one resourceLocator per report task. This may include looking up the resource for a data file to be used in a data source connection or data set query. An user should be able to specify a JavaScript expression in the Property Binding feature to specify the use of a registered resource locator. Suggest to support a syntax like "birtresource://myfolder/a.xml" in a JavaScript expression, which during evaluation would trigger the use of the registered IResourceLocator in Model to do the file search for "myfolder/a.xml". The URL returned would then be the evaluated value of the JS expression.
