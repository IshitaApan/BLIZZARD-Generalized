BIRT's numeric format can produce "-0"

Created attachment 94811 Product Sales by Country.rptdesign Open the attached report that uses the Classic Models sample database. Preview it. Notice on the line for Australia, NSW, the change is "-0". This is probably due to rounding errors. The value is probably something like -0.1 which, when rounded to no digits past the decimal displays as 0, but the negative calculation is done off of the original value. The only problem is, aside from cryptic computer math cases, -0 is the same as 0 and is displayed as 0. The workaround, I guess, is for me to do my own rounding in the expression for the field, but this means that the field no longer holds the actual number an can affect downstream uses of that field. Plus, it is just more work for the developer. Expected that BIRT would do the right thing for me. If I specify rounding (by saying 0 digits past the decimal point), BIRT will round the number first, THEN apply the negative sign if needed. This is the technique used in most other software, such as Excel.
