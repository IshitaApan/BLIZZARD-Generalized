SQL data set editor too slow in getting metadata

Created attachment 105225 call tree from NetBeans profiler showing excessive database calls Build ID: N/A Steps To Reproduce: Create a data set against an Oracle database that has many visible database objects (schemas, tables, views, stored procedures.) More information: This was reported on the newsgroup on Nov. 17, 2006: news://news.eclipse.org:119/ejk0it$3h7$1@utils.eclipse.org In BIRT 2.2 (with an Oracle 10 driver) pulling up the SQL editor took just over one minute on my database. In BIRT 2.3.0RC4 (with an Oracle 11 driver) it takes just over three minutes. This makes using BIRT somewhat annoying. (Between this and changing the page-break semantics mid-2.2, I am stuck running an older version of BIRT.) I profiled BIRT 2.3.0RC4 and found that in order to "Prefetch all Schemas from database" as in Preferences->Report Design->Data Set Editor->JDBC Data Set, it required 639 queries to my database. I've attached a call tree from the NetBeans profiler. It appears that the logic to populate the schema list needs to be rewritten to understand when it can fetch metadata in bulk.
