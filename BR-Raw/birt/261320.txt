Set Fractional Metrics to off by rendering in case of low dpi.

This is a bug in SwingDisplayServer, but affects on all renderer except SWT, because all text metricses are based on Java Graphics 2D except SWT. Shortly to say we should set the RenderingHints.KEY_FRACTIONALMETRICS of Graphics2D to on in large dpi cases (>192), and to off in small dpi cases(<192). For more info about fractional metrics: http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/reference/faqs/index.html#Q_What_are_fractional_metrics_Wh That is what we supposed to do. But in fact we follow this dpi logic only during computation, during rendering the FRACTIONALMETRICS is always on. Which means the result is wrong for small dpi and causes computing error by computing text width. Therefore we need to follow the same logic during rendering to make the resualt consistent.
