Awkward experience when quoting report parameter in script.

description: Awkward experience when quoting report parameter in script. build id: 2.3.1 v20080731-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a report with a chart and a report parameter. 2. Add a interactivity to the chart. Define action as Invoke Script and input script as alert(params["NewParameter"].value) and click OK in the expresion builder. 3. Preview the chart and invoke the interactivity.You will get error. 4. Try changing the script to alert("params["NewParameter"].value"). You will be reminded to correct the script as it contains syntax error when you try to close the expresion builder. But the script works well when preview. Expected result: I do not quite understand why the double quotation mark is a must.If you quote the CategoryData, there's no need for the quotation mark. So I wonder if we can remove the quotation mark for consistency.
