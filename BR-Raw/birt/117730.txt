SVG output is blank in IE with J2EE 1.4.2_10

I installed the J2EE from sun: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/download.html#sdk . I think I did the full install, I got a appserver directory on my drive, and use the jdk inside this directory. When trying to render SVG charts, it doesn't output the xmlns namespace, as a result IE shows a blank rectangle for the SVG content. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><svg xmlns="" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" height="333.0" width="533.0"><g style="fill:none;stroke:none"><defs/><script><![CDATA[function BuildHelper(tag, attrList, text) { this.tag = tag; this.attrList = attrList; this.text = text; this.element = null; this.textNode = null; } It works fine with a standard j2se install
