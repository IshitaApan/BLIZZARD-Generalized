Vertical merge kills cells / rows after page break

Created attachment 108434 Example with a killed row in PDF-view Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a new (blank) Report 2. Add a large Table with at least 3 columns 3. Extend e.g. the header do 3 rows. 4. Select the second column and add a page break before it (-> Page Break -> Before -> Always) 5. Perform a vertical merge with 2 cells in the header after the page break (e.g. merge the cells of row 2 and 3 in column 3) 5. Fill cells with text, select borders or use colors to identify the cells (will be helpful later), e.g. add a green background to the merged cell 7. View Report as PDF More information: You will see that the merged cells have been "killed" and in more "complex" reports (see attachment) a vertical merge after a page break might also kill a full row (the upper one of the merged cell). Normal preview and merges before page breaks look fine.
