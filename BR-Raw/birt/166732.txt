Duplicate id isn't handled in BIRT viewer tag.[0603]

Description: Duplicate id isn't handled in BIRT viewer tag. Build number:2.2.0.v20061204 Steps to reproduce: 1. New a jsp file from BIRT tag template with default path in BIRT web Project. 2. Input content in body as: <birt:viewer id="1" reportDesign="birt_tag_sample.rptdesign" > </birt:viewer> <birt:viewer id="1" reportDesign="birt_tag_sample1.rptdesign" > </birt:viewer>. 3. Run the project on Server and type http://localhost:port/$context_root/$jspFileName.jsp Expected result: Error message about duplicate id property value. Actual result: Only the second report displayed. Another issue: If I changed id to "-1", the frame containing the report couldn't showed up, either. I tried several characters and only "$" and "_" could work. Do we have any constraint in id value? Error log:N/A
