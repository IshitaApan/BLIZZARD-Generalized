Data Set Parameter Bindings for Joint Data Set- Tables are ignored

Created attachment 142422 Report describing the issue I unfortunately discovered a bug. I have a Report which is working fine under BIRT 2.3.2. After updating to 2.5.0 I noticed that the "Data Set Parameter Bindings" for "Join Data Sets" are ignored. By default, parameters can be defined for "Data Sets". They can be overridden by using the "Data Set Parameter Bindings"-Feature of the "Table" Report Item. This works for Birt 2.3.2 and 2.5.0 as well. But when the Data Set is a "Joint Data Set", only the Parameter defined in the used "Data Sets" are used. Any definition as "Data Set Parameter Bindings" in a "Table" Report Item is ignored. I designed a simple report that demonstrates the issue. The 1. Table is using the default Parameter of the dataset. The 2. Tables uses the as "Data Set Parameter Bindings". The 3. Table is a Joint Data Set, using default parameters The 4. Table uses "Data Set Parameter Bindings" but brings the same Data as Table#3 It would be great if the behaviour of BIRT 2.3.2 could be restored.
