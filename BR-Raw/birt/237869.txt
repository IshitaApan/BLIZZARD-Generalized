Pie value series does not allow string type data  even when it's aggregation is set as count.

Created attachment 105460 screenshot descriptiion: Pie value series does not allow string type data even when it's aggregation is set as count. build id: 2.3.0 v20080619-1030 steps to reproduce: 1. New a datasource with sample db and new a dataset with table customers. 2. New a chart, using the dataset. 3. Select country as category,in grouping dialog, enable the grouping. 4. Set the aggregation on value series as count and try to drag customername as value sereies. Expected result: Customername though with a string type should be accepted. Actual result: Customername can be not accepted as value sereies. Please see attached screenshot. But if the switch to bar chart and drag the cutomername as value sereis, then swtich back to pie chart, it works.
