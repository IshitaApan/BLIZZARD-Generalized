description: Background image of chart does not work the same as other report items when the report is under a subfolder. build id: 2.3.1 v20080820-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a report project. 2. New a folder under the project. 3. New a report with chart under the folder. 4. Add an image to the folder. 5. In the report, select Chart. In the Advanced tab of properties editor, input the image name as backgroud image. Actual result: The chart becomes error in layout. But it works with the image path as '\folder\image'. However, this is not consistent with other report items, like label,table or crosstab. Expected result: The path of image background of chart should work the same way as other report items.
