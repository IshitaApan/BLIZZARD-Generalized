Cryptic error message when BIRT can't find a JS file

This is related to Bug 229906. Using BIRT 2.2.2, create a JavaScript file with some common functions. Let's call this example.js. If we have a shared image or CSS file, we'd put it in the Resources folder in our project. So, let's try the same with example.js. For our purposes, JS function: function sampleJSFunc( ) { return "sampleJSFunc( ) called"; } Next, create a design called JS_Example.rptdesign with one data item that calls the above function. Save and close the report design. Next, edit the report design to add the required XML: <list-property name="includeScripts"> <property>example.js</property> </list-property> Open the design in the report editor and preview. We get an error: The following items have errors: ReportDesign (id = 1): + Error evaluating Javascript expression. Script engine error: ReferenceError: "sampleJSFunc" is not defined. (source#2) Script source: source, line: 0, text: sampleJSFunc( ) Bug 229906 says that BIRT does not support reading JS files from the Resource directory. This says that the above error was presumably because BIRT could not find our included JS file. But, notice that the error says that it can't find a given function; no error was given for the failed file load. Expected that BIRT would report something like "Could not find file example.js" so I could figure out the actual problem. Even better, tell me what the search path is that is used: "Could not find example.js in the file system root folder."
