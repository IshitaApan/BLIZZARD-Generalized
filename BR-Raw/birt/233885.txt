Bubble chart does not work correctly with secondary Y axis.

description: Bubble chart does not work correctly with secondary Y axis. build id: 2.3.0 v20080523-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a datasouce with sample db and new a dataset with table payments(fitler: customernumber<114). 2. New a chart, on select Chart Type tab, select Secondary Axis for Multiple Y Axis. 3. On select data tab, select checknumber as category, select amount as series1 for axis1 and select paymentdate as series1 for axis2. 4. On select chart type tab, select chart type as bubble. 5. On select data tab, select customernumber as the size of the two series. Actual Result: In step4, the axis labels disappear.I guess this is caused by the paymentdate type is incompatible with size. In step5, the plot area becomes empty. Expected Result: In step4, there should be a warning that the data type is incompatible. In step5, preview should be correct.
