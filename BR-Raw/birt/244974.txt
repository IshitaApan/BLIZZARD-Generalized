Created attachment 110693 Example chart Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a bar chart with any number of series 2. In type some words for the series titles so that the title needs to be word wrapped 3. In "Format Chart" -> "Chart Area" -> "Legend" click "Layout" and choose "Position: below" and "Direction: Left Right" Actual Result: lines are broken in the middle of a word Expected Result: new lines should start after a proper word wrap More information: At least until BIRT 2.2.1 the word wrap was ok. I did not check BIRT 2.2.2. My installation of BIRT 2.2.1 runs with Eclipse Europe Version 3.3.1.1 Build id M20071023-1652, my installation of BIRT 2.3.0 runs with Eclipse Ganymede Version 3.4.0 build I20080617-2000 Attached a report design based on the ClassicModel example database for illustration. The report was made with BIRT 2.2.1, but the behaviour described can also be witnessed creating a new report with BIRT 2.3.0
