Enhancement: Switching to script panel should put focus in the editor window

Created attachment 129335 Screenshot describing the focus problem Overview: When switching to the Script panel, the focus should be set to the editor (the big text area) instead of the drop down list which lists the different events. Steps to Reproduce: 1) Load a report. 2) Switch to the Script panel. Actual Results: The event drop down list is given focus. Expected Results: The text editor should be given focus. Additional Comments: It's a little frustrating, especially when you are editing longer scripts. When I switch to the script panel, and am planning to view/edit the code at the bottom of the script, without thinking use the scroll wheel. But because the drop down list has focus and not the editor, I cycle through the different events that are available instead of scrolling to code at the end of the file.
