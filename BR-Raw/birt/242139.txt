BIRT ODA Host Designer should have honored the SessionStatus of an ODA Design Session Response

When an ODA design session finishes, an ODA host application like BIRT should have always first checked for the sessionStatus of an oda.design.DesignSessionResponse. Only if the sessionStatus has the "Ok" value, it can then continue to process the response' design and designerState, and update its corresponding design handle. Otherwise, if the sessionStatus has one of the error status, BIRT should not make any changes to the related design handles in the report design. Normally, if a response has an error sessionStatus, the response may have a null or incomplete DataSourceDesign or DataSetDesign instance. This applies to both the Data Source and Data Set design sessions. And for both creating a new design and editing an existing one.
