API breakage from BIRT 2.1.x to BIRT 2.2 with XML stream

This problem is a result of a change in the Constants.APPCONTEXT_INPUTSTREAM. This is mentioned in Bug #163732: "The bug is caused by the migration of BIRT xml driver to DTP xml driver. The legacy code which use constants defined in BIRT xml driver would break. I've made the report context constants defined in BIRT xml driver and DTP xml driver consistent to solve the problem." Public constants should not change between releases. This is like changing a public api. This is causing backward compatilbity problems with TPTP. This is the scenario that is breaking: TPTP 4.4.1 is compiled with BIRT 2.2. As a result the org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml.Constants.APPCONTEXT_INPUTSTREAM BIRT 2.2 value is inlined in the TPTP 4.4.1 class. Now, if I use TPTP 4.4.1 with BIRT 2.1.x the reports break because BIRT 2.1.x is expecting a different constant value. This is a major problem for other users that have products compiled with BIRT 2.2 and want to run with lower version of BIRT. One of the driving forces with using BIRT 2.1.x is that BIRT 2.1.x can be used with JDK 1.4 while BIRT 2.2.x can not use JDK 1.4.
