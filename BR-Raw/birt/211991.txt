Page header items when in a grid within a grid disappear on runtime render

Created attachment 84519 Example design file showing problem Build ID: 3.2.2 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a new blank report. 2. Switch to the Master Page view. 3. In the header create a new 2x2 grid 4. In the North East cell create a grid with three rows and a single column. 5. In the sub-grid, insert an embedded image into rows 1&3. I have used the same image. 6. Insert a text item into row 2 with some sample text. 7. Use the preview tab to check that the page is rendered as expected. 8. Move the design file over to a tomcat server using the Runtime servlet version 2.2.1.1 9. Access the design file via a browser (I'm on Firefox V2.0.0.11). The page is rendered without the header information. More information: I you move one of the image items from the sub-grid into the North West cell and access the design file from tomcat, the image is render correctly, but the sub-grid is still missing.
