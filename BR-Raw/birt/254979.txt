Too many x-axis grid lines on "category axis"

Created attachment 117619 Snapshot of a graph with markings showing the problem Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a report with a dataset of +- 300 records and two columns. The first column containing date-time values, one per hour for each day, ordered by date-time. Add a second column containing numbers to the dataset. This problem also occurs with X-axis containing numbers. 2. Create a line or area chart to display this data. X-Axis is the date-time column from the dataset and Y-axis is the number column. Size is 500px high, 900px wide. 3. On "format chart", go to X-Axis format, tick "Is Category Axis". 4. Click on "Gridlines" button and tick "Major Grid". Choose a visible grid line color and style to be solid. This is normally default. 5. Preview the chart. More information: A grid line is shown for every x-axis entry (each record) instead of only showing one major grid line per x-axis label. I would think that would be the function of the minor grid. The grid lines are shown correctly (or as I would think they should) when changing x-axis to a value axis chart (clear tick in X-axis "Is category axis" option). Unfortunately, due to the bugs 254977 and 254978, this does not look good. See marker A in the attached sample graph.
