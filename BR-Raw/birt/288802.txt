Created attachment 146639 screen shot description: 2D+ area chart in cross tab is not correct in this case. build id: 2.5.1 v20090908-1029 steps to reproduce: 1. New a data set with table customers in sample db.(filter: customernumber < 144) 2. New a cube using the data set, customernumber as dimension and creditlimit as measure. 3. Drag the cube to layout and show measure as chart. 4. Double click the chart,change type to scatter (You will see the category order changes)and close chart builder. 5. Open chart builder again, change type to area and select dimension as 2D+. Actual result: Live preview is not correct now. See attached screen shot. There is also problem with other 2D+ type, like bar. Area chart is most typical. Preview is correct as it seems only occur under specific data condition.
