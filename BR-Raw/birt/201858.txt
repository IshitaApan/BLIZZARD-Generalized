Provide utility method for UI to check the proper aggregation type of xTab measure.

UI need a utility method to set up a proper aggregation type for measure. The mapping is about the following two entities: 1. The aggregation that is used to create fact table 2. The aggregation of measure used in xTab. The mapping should follow the below rules: Aggregation used to create fact table aggregation of measure in xTab Count SUM CountDistinct SUM *AVERAGE SUM As per bug 201857 we will remove "AVERAGE" from cube builder, to keep backward compatibility, we should simply map all Average aggregation to SUM. All the aggregation that is not mentioned here should be kept as it is. Please also notice that as we are recently change to use DtE as aggregation function provider, and some aggregation key string are different from model, say "weightedAve"-->"weighted-Ave". In this Utility method we should also take this into consideration. The Utility method should lies in class ICubeQueryUtil in data adapter.
