DateTimeSpan at preview of DataSet

Created attachment 92505 sample report where error occures while previewing DataSet results when editing DataSet itself When one creates a Dataset, a parameter can be set for that DataSet and give this DataSet-parameter a default value. So far ok. The problem is when the default value of the DataSet-parameter is set to bellow expression: DateTimeSpan.addDate(params["NewParameter"],0,1,0) When editing this DataSet and then clicking 'Preview results' button of the Data Set it appears an error: 'Cannot convert 2004-01-01 to java.util.Date' The report runs fine in preview mode of the Report Designer as well as on our JBoss server. When I substitute expression: DateTimeSpan.addDate(params["NewParameter"],0,1,0) with: params["NewParameter"] then previewing DataSet results works fine. More of that problem (further explanation) as well as sample report where this problem is occuring can be seen at newsgroup discussion forum: http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.birt/msg26506.html
