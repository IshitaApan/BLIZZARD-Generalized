getInputParameterValue() unavailable from the 'open' event in a Scripted DataSet

Created attachment 129323 Sample Report that exhibits the problem described Overview: The function 'getInputParameterValue()' cannot be found by code within the Scripted DataSet 'open' event. Intellisense however reports that the 'this' object has a function named 'getInputParameterValue()'. Furthermore, if the offending code from the 'open' event is moved to the 'beforeOpen' event, the report engine is able to locate the 'getInputParameterValue()' function. Steps to reproduce: Either see the attached report, OR: 1. Create a report with a Scripted DataSet and associated Scripted DataSource. Add a single column to the report (of type String) called 'foo'. 2. Create a input DataSet parameter for the Scripted DataSet. Name the parameter "bar". Give the parameter a default value (e.g. "fooobar") 3. Add the following code to the 'open' event for the Scripted DataSet: bar = this.getInputParameterValue("bar"); i = 0; 4. Add the following code to the 'fetch' event for the Scripted DataSet: if (i >= 10) return false; row["foo"] = bar; i++; return true; 4. Modify the body of the report so that the report includes a table linked to the Scripted DataSet. 5. Preview or run the report. Actual Results: The reporting engine will raise an exception while trying to run the script. The root exception looks like: Caused by: org.mozilla.javascript.EcmaError: TypeError: Cannot find function getInputParameterValue. (<inline>#2) Expected Results: I expected that the 'open' script would be able to call the getInputParameterValue function to get the value of the DataSet parameter. This would then result in a report containing a single column with 'fooobar' repeated 10 times. Build Date & Platform: Eclipse build id: I20090202-1535 Birt Report Runtime build id: v20090210-0630
