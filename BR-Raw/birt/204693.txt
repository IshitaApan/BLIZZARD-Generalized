Error concatenating images especially in PDF output

Created attachment 79210 Sample report design Build ID: BIRT-RCP-REPORT-DESIGNER-2_1_3 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a text element containing HTML with two img tags 2. Be sure the start tag of second image follows directly the end tag of prev. image (no space / no line break) 3. Render with HTML. You will see that the images are not rendered side by side but with white space in between. More information: Reason for this behaviour is that the HTML input supplied with the text element is reformatted by the report engine si that everay img tag is on its own line! Conclusion: BIRT should preserve the HTML input and do not reformat it. A (ugly) work around is to put the images in a table with one row and two cells with cellspacing and cellpadding set to 0. A followup problem of the workaround is, that the HTML viewer now renders as expected but the PDF renderer ignores the table and shows no output at all. See attached a zip with a report design file and the output from HTML and PDF viewer, also I've attached a ZIP file with the 3 images used in the test.
