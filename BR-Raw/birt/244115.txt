Need to pass timezone argument to DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object)

In the project org.eclipse.birt.core : Please add a new method DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object, TimeZone timeZone) which behaves the same way as DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object) but using the passed time zone. Internally it uses DataTypeUtil.toDate(String) which then uses DataTypeUtil.toDateISO8601(String). So the class DateFormatISO8601 will need to be modified as well. We need to pass the time zone information for this enhancement bug: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=238806 Please also improve the comments, because it seems that DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object) and DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object,ULocale) use very different date formats and logic. Since these methods have the same name, it is not clear that their behavior is very different: DataTypeUtil.toDate(Object) uses the ISO8601 date format when the object is a string. The second one tries to parse the string using a list of predefined default date formats.
