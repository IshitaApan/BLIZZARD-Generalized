PDF Report Generated With Layout But No Data

Our application is a Java5, using JBoss 4.02sp1. We correctly generate all 16 reports in HTML We correctly generate 12 of 16 reports in PDF form. PROBLEM: 4 of the PDF versions are generated with the layout done correctly and the header (of our report) correctly containing the data. However, in these four reports, the PDF versions have the empty layout but the actual data only appears off to the side as bookmarks. It's as if they data was not inserted correctly. I know the data was generated because it appears in the bookmark values correctly. Will be happy to supply the .rptdesign files, the integration source, the JBoss logs and an example of the PDF with this behavior. Can be contacted at: tyronehed@earthlink.net. Thank you! Ty
