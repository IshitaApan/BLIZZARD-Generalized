Adding a Path when creating a new report causes an exception

The following directory exists: SchoolPsychology/Reports If I try to generate a report by appending /Test so I have the directory field be: SchoolPsychology/Reports/Test I always get: An unexpected internal exception occurred.Please see log for detail. Plug-in Provider:Eclipse.org Plug-in Name:BIRT Designer UI Plug-in ID:org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui Version:1.0.1 Error Code:Error.GUIException.invokedByUnexpectedException Error Message:Caused by java.lang.NullPointerException I can work around this by creating the directory manually. I just installed 1.0.1 and am trying BIRT for the first time. I have EMF 2.1 and GEF 3.1. I am running on XPhome and 1.4.2_06 This is repeatable.
