Proxy problems with birt-viewer.

I've deployed the 2.1.1 birt-viewer application online to my Tomcat 5.5 server which is currently going through our network proxy. While i can generate and view reports going through the local network, going through the proxy server fails. I checked the source of the generated html and saw the following: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd"> <HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>BIRT&#32;Report&#32;Viewer</TITLE> <BASE href="http://localhost:8080/birt-viewer/webcontent/birt" > <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; CHARSET=utf-8"> <LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="birt/styles/style.css" TYPE="text/css"> The base href needs to be configurable or changeable. Since I plan to deploy the birt-viewer gehind a proxy setup this is a major problem. The proxy is always going to be running on the local host, so that it's never going to be the server name. Is there a work around for this issue? Thank you for the help.
