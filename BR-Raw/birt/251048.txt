Setting scatter chart background with embedded image doesn't work

Build ID: 3.4.0 Steps To Reproduce: I whish to set the background of a chart to an image. When I do this I have only 2 options for the source file - 1. URI 2. Embedded Image (Although the image Item has 4 options of the source) When I try to use the embedded image (After adding an embedded image seperatly) I only enter the image name - xxx.jpg that I embedded.. But this does not seem to work.. (The labels for the embedded file name is - "Enter the path of the image to embed"... I get an error - "no prototocol - xxx.jpg" when I try to preview the image.
