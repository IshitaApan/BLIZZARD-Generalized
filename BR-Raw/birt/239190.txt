Not able to determine current title of current series in IChartEventHandler.beforeDrawLegendItem

I want to modify the label of the series title currently being rendered on the legend area, but cannot determine the actual series. Problem (see http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=29058&group=eclipse.birt#29058 for more info): """ If the legend area is too small or has not enough space to render the series title, it will be shortened (e.g. "Very Long Series Title" becomes "Very Long S..."). Thus, the comparison will fail and there is no other way to determine which series title is currently being rendered on the legend area... I think, there must be a hint given to beforeDrawLegendItem to be able to determine the series; maybe an additional param with the series identifier (beforeDrawLegendItem(..., Object seriedID ))...
