BIRT Viewer Sample does not shut down cleanly

Deploy BIRT WebViewerExample in Tomcat. Run a report that uses the Classic Models Sample Database. Next examine the Temp directory (depending on Tomcat setup this could be in the temp directory under Tomcat home, or it could be the system temp directory), make sure that you find a directory named similar to this: /BIRTSampleDB_1149953779438_3a78ad This is the SampleDB temp file created by the sampledb plugin. Now shut down Tomcat service. The above named directory remains. This is a bug - it means that the Report Engine's OSGi platform has not been shutdown cleanly (therefore the sampledb plugin activator's Stop method is never called). Please check if Viewer has called "org.eclipse.birt.core.framework.Platform.shutdown( )". EXPECTED RESULT: When Tomcat shuts dow, the BIRTSampleDB_xxx_xxx directory should be removed.
