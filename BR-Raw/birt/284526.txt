Paging problem in pdf emitter

Created attachment 142468 Sample report to reproduce the problem I have found a problem which is causing the pdf emitter to go into a loop (generated pdf just keeps on growing). The problem can be replicated with the attached sample report in the viewer in frameset mode, when you attempt to export the report to pdf. Please note the following in the report: - the row containing 'sample text 1' is setup to avoid page break after and inside - the row containing 'sample text 2' is setup to avoid page break before, after and inside - the row containing the table is setup to avoid page break before and inside - the problem manifest itself only if the inner table spans more than a page (just removing one line from dataset2 will cause the report to work properly)
