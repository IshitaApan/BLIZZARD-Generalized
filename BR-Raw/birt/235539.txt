description: Can not "undo" after adding a datasource from library to report. build id: 2.3.0 v20080604-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a library with a datasource. 2. New a report. 3. In Resource Explorer, right click the datasource and select add to report. 4. Try to undo the operation. Expected result: This operation can be undone. Actual result: Undo is disabled and you can not undo. However, if you add a label to the report and select undo. First "undo" will remove the label. Second "undo" will remove the datasource. This means "Add to report" can be undone, but it was disabled at first.
