text align problem in BIRT 2.5.1

Created attachment 152389 report to test the problem I've found a problem testing with some text and dynamic text elements inside a grid with justified alignment. I've attached a report example. In the report the elements from the right side are a copy from the elements of the left side, except than in the content of the elements from the right side, I have added one character more (a "2"). When I display the report in pdf, the right elements aren't displayed ok.
