[XML Data Source Improvements] Addition of XML Duration Data Type

The duration data type is used to specify a time interval. Many XML data sources use the duration data type. [Duration Data Type seems like a major oversight, and one that should be easy to remedy] The time interval is specified in the following form "PnYnMnDTnHnMnS" where: * P indicates the period (required) * nY indicates the number of years * nM indicates the number of months * nD indicates the number of days * T indicates the start of a time section (required if you are going to specify hours, minutes, or seconds) * nH indicates the number of hours * nM indicates the number of minutes * nS indicates the number of seconds The following is an example of a duration declaration in a schema: <xs:element name="period" type="xs:duration"/> An element in the document might look like this: <period>P5Y</period> The example above indicates a period of five years. Or it might look like this: <period>P5Y2M10D</period> The example above indicates a period of five years, two months, and 10 days.
