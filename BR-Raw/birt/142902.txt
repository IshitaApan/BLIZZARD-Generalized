oda.xml plugin incorrectly make internal classes visible

In the MANIFEST.MF file of the org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml plugin, the following packages are exported: org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml.util org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml.ui This declaration makes all classes in these packages part of the public API, for which we must always maintain backward compatibility in future release. However almost all classes in these packages are infact internal implemetation classes which should not be used by other plugins. This plugin should be restructured so that: (1) public API classes (which could include the Constants class which contains public constants of interest to xml driver users) should be moved to a package with "api" in its name. (2) All non-public packages should be removed from the export list of the manifest file.
