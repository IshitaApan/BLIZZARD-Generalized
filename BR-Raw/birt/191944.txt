Extensible ExpressionProvider

Hi all, I'm developing a custom BIRT RCP Editor along with custom ODA extensions. The framework also exposes several helper methods that need to be used in the report expressions for parameter binding, dynamic text report elements or table column expressions. My intention is now to somehow be able to extend the ExpressionProvider used by BIRT to help the user build an expression. As I have seen in the code the ExpressionProvider used for the different contexts (parameter, dynamic text, etc.) is somewhat hardcoded. Additionally there is a default implementation that will be used when no provider is set. Would it be possible to extend this behaviour so RCP developers can control which IExpressionProvider will be used in a certain context? This could be done for example as extensions to a new extension-point (org.eclipse.birt.*.expressionProvider). These extensions could return an implementation of IExpressionProvider per context that would be used in addition to the entries already provided by the BIRT implementation. Best regards Alex
