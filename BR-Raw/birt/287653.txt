Area charts are not rendered correctly over an incoherent X-Axis

Created attachment 145631 Example: area series diagram (broken) and the same diagram with line series. Be sure to adjust the path to the CSV file. The error is that BIRT assumes a value of 0 if there is no value in the data set. This results in the area not being connected from the first Y-value to the second, but to 0 first. This occurs if another data series has an x-value in between the two X-values of the area series. This behaviour seems to be exclusive to area series. Line series show the behaviour I would expect. I will include an example showing a diagram with area series showing the incorrect behaviour and the same diagram with a line series showing the expected behaviour. I file this bug report, after discussing the issue in the BIRT exchange forum: http://www.birt-exchange.org/forum/designing-birt-reports/16300-area-series-not-rendered-correctly-complex-chart.html
