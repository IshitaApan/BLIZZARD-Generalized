ScriptedDataSet does not use the same classloader when ran for Parameters than when ran for the report

I have ScriptedDataSets that are built from Java classes in my RCP plug-in. I use the WebViewer. I managed, by starting WebAccessor.start (), giving my own plug-in ID and copying the birt directory in my plug-in, to get the report to work. The ScriptedDataSets works very well in the reports. Though, when the dataset is used to populate a parameter's combo box values, it does not work. The log say that the classes can't be found. I can't have my Jar file copied in the "scriptlib" directory. That's not the Eclipse plug-in architecture and it would not work with dynamic installation of new features to have to copy the plug-in's jar file.
