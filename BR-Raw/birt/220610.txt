Report as PPT sends "data corrupt" with Windows XP

Created attachment 90896 Message box with german region settings with Report as PPT on Windows XP Build ID: 2.3.0.v20080218-1354 Steps To Reproduce: 1. create a report with "BIRT RCP Designer" 2.3.0M5 (or M4) (a very easy or empty report will be OK) 2. set in XP "system settings" --> "Region and language options" to "german (germany)" (I tested it with italien and france too) save and close. 3. In BIRT call Run --> Run Report --> As PPT 4. A window appears with a message like "Proplems when load, Data corrupt (presentation)" 5. click OK and the report will be displayed correct. 6. store this PPT and open again with PPT, the message do not appears a second time. More information: First I have had the closed bug 205557 with BIRT 2.1.1. This was one reason why I tried 2.3.0M4 (and now M5). But now I get this described bug. Today I found out that this bug will not appear with English settings in Windows XP (Professional Version 2002, SP2), but with other languages. Tip: it can be a problem with date-format or the european decimal-comma (instaed of point). A big customer is using PPT-Reports with german settings, and this bug is very unhandsome for the users.
