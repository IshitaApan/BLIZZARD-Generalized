Chart With Hyperlink Using Empty Parameter Causes Trigger Failure

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create an empty new report (or use the attached report) 2. Create a chart, and a parameter ("EmptyParameter" in this example) 3. Use the sample database -- so far any data source and data set can replicate this 4. Edit the hyperlink and make it a drill-down, and for the puroses of making this quickly, point the report to itself (another report works too). As in shown image, put in "EmptyParameter" and use its own value. 5. When you preview the report it will fail with the attached image and the following error: "The following items have errors: Chart NewChart: + The trigger data is invalid or its type is unknown" Now if you change the parameter on the report (using a tomcat viewer or a web viewer) so that EmptyParameter is no longer blank, the chart will display. Other places that you can use hyperlinks (on a label, for example) do not have this problem. More information:
