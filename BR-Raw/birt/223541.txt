Display Name on Ouptup Columns ignores column alias

Created attachment 93182 Screenie after entering example query Build ID: I20080207-1530 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create MySQL based JDBC data source with latest 5.1 driver. 2. Create Data Set with this or similar query: (Notice a couple of duplicate column names) select f.form_id, d.form_id, p.first_name as camper_first, p.last_name as camper_last, s.first_name as staff_first, s.last_name as staff_last from form as f INNER JOIN form_director as d on d.form_id = f.form_id INNER JOIN person as p on f.person_id = p.person_id INNER JOIN person as s on f.staff_id = s.person_id 3. Navigate to resulting "Output Columns" screen. Display Name will by incorrectly assigned. The first pair of columns gets the display names of the the second set of columns. The second set of columns do not get any display names. More information: Windows XP MySql tunneled through SSH Connection com.mysql.jdbc.Driver (v5.1) jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/database_name?zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull To make matters worse, when copying a Data Set colum from the Outline window into a list/grid/table the column name is used instead of the display name. So you wind up looking at something linke first_name_8.
