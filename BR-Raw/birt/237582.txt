legend in bar chart does not display series names

Created attachment 105254 screenshot of my bar chart with more than one series and the optional y series grouping it is not possible to display the series names and the y series group names. In my case I have two measures "order count" and "amount". My bars are stacked. The optional y series grouping is defined by the payment method used for the order. The ditinction between ordercount and amount is not possible by looking at the legend. Another label for each series is needed. Using scripting it is possible to display a series dependent y series grouping name as shown in the screenshot. That is not pretty though.
