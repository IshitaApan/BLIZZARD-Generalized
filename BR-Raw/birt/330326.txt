Special Characters in ExcelEmitter not correct (Encoding?)

Build Identifier: 2_6_2-N20101116 Reports using special characters (Umlaute, EURO-Sign) do not render them correctly in Excel-Format. They do appear correctly in PDF, DOC and HTML. I actually wanted to use Birt 2.6.1 but found out that the PageMargins are not set in the Excel-Format (explained here: http://www.birt-exchange.org/org/forum/index.php/topic/20859-page-border-in-xls/). I could see, that this is fixed in the 2.6.1-CVS-Branch and the CVS-Head. I could not see a 2.6.1 build containing that fix so I tried the nightly build. PageMargins are set correctly now but now Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the report design attached 2. Run it as Excel
