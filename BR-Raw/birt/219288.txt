[Linux] Problem when debug java script.

Created attachment 89951 screenshot description: Problem when debug java script build version: 2.3.0 v2080218-0800 steps to reproduce: 1. New a report design with a label. 2. Select the label and add script to the label,eg. this.text="this is a label". 3. Add a breakpoint to the script. 4. Debug the report. Tick on Run and Render in Task Type,tick on Java Script as Debug type,tick on "Open generated file when finished". Apply and debug. Expected result: 1. Should stop at the breakpoint. 2. After resume debug, the generated file is opened. Actual result: 1. Source not found in OnPrepare method. See attached screenshot. 2. After resume debug, the result file is generated but not opened automatically, which means the "Open generated file when finished" option doesn't work.
