Drill-Through forces pagination... frameset forces pagination

After switching from Birt1.0 to Birt 201 and/or Birt 2.1M5 My html reports were pagenated... when that was not desired. It made using html hyperlinks hard. The fix was switching from birt-viewer/frameset? to birt-viewer/run? in the links. OK... I understand that. ( http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/deploy/viewerUsage.php ) But... functionality was lost... parameters could not be set and pdf could not be generated. Turning on frameset turns on pagination... bad... 3 pages of what should be a compound report (unless I'm doing something wrong) So... trying to use the Drill-Through hyperlink option... I run into the same problem = Pagenated HTML pages where no pagenation is wanted. I specify: * The drill-Through report * The drill-Through report parameters * Target = Parent * Format = html yet the report comes out pagenated... as if it was calling on frameset rather than run. Nothing seems to show in the XML. How can I turn pagenation OFF for html reports? Thanks...
