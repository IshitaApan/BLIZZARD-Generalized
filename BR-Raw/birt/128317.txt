group header and footer checkboxes

I suggest to remove checkboxes "Include group header" and "Include group footer" from Group detail window. Reasons: 1) There is confusing regarding using those checkboxes. Some users could think about them like the way to control the visibility of header/footer for existing header/footer group rows. Other users will try to use them to create new header and footer for group. 2) Make sense to define visibility property directly to group header and footer. Good example of using visibility propery can be find in grid component. 3)A little more consistent approach if take in account how user work with detail and footer row. 4) These checkboxes added unnecessary complexity for users and developers of report designer. To see prove of it you can check comments related to bug 125166. The link: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125166 5) In moment of creating new group it's better to allow user to create only group header. In case user need group footer he must make explicit action for that. That how user act in case adding regular footer. By the way I can't find anything in documentation regarding how to use checkboxes "Include group header" and "Include group footer".
