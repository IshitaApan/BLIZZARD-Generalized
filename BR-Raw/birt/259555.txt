Null values in Data Cubes problem

Created attachment 121121 Error Message Hi! We found a problem building a datacube from a data set with more then 4000 rows and some null value in any summary field. So: Steps To Reproduce: - create a dataset that return more than 4000 rows and some null field; - create a datacube from that query and insert the null field in summary field; - running the report we got the attached error We found this error in 2.3.1 and 2.3.2N20081219 too, both runtime and designer. We think the problem happens when Birt store the cube data in temporary file: finding some summary fields with values and some nulls, it does something wrong so that later trying to write the null cells (in org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.olap.data.document/AbstractBufferedRandomAccessObject.java --> writeBigDecimal ) it raises the exception! We solved inserting NVL in the query, to fill null values with '0'... but sometimes '0' and null have different meanings! Wish this can help... Immediando S.r.L.
