Created attachment 111174 re Description: Chart binding is not refreshed after remove one computed column from the data set. Build number: 2.3.1.v20080828-1307 Steps to reproduce: 1. New a data set binding to CUSTOMERS, add a computed column test, select COUNT as Aggregation. 2. New a chart, in "Select Data" tab, binding to the data set, click "Data Binding" button, click "Add Aggregation" button, select COUNT as Funtion and click OK and finish the chart. 3. Edit the data set and delete the computed column test and save the report. 4. Open the Chart Builder and error message (Column binding "test" has referred to a data set column "test" which does not exist.) is shown and this is expected. 5. Select "Inherit Data from Container", then select "Use Data from Data Set". Expected result: No error message is shown. Actual result: The error message (Column binding "test" has referred to a data set column "test" which does not exist.) is still shown. Error log: N/A.
