JDBC Data Set Editor should load tables and columns on demand

The JDBC Data Set Editor page for a SQL Query has a tree control that lists the tables and columns in your data source. On the iSeries platform using the JTOpen JDBC drivers, this tree control shows every schema (aka catalog) on the system. This is easly several hundred tables. When the data set editor is opened you have to wait while the entire schema is queried and eventually get the "Only 500 items can be viewed in the available list...". Bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=101372">101372</a> asks for the ability to filter based on schema. Using the code in CVS from 6/30/05, I see the schema filter, however I still have the warning message on load since the tree is being populated on load. Could the load of the tree be deferred until the user expands the tree or applys a filter?
