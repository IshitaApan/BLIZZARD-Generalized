Export to Excel. Problem with number's patterns

Created attachment 107481 Examples (.rptdesign and .xls). BIRT 2.2 vs BIRT 2.3 Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Add data field with type=float to any report 2. Set it to constant value = 1234.56789 3. Set pattern = #0.0 (one digit after decimal point) 4. Run the report (you should see 1234.6) 5. Make export to Excel (you should see 1234.5678, WHICH IS NOT MATCHED TO PATTERN) More information: This bug appears only in BIRT v.2.3.0 BIRT v.2.2 produces Excel output correctly. The reason for this "feature" is following - output XLS file contains: <NumberFormat ss:Format="#0.0"/> (for BIRT v.2.2 - correct) <NumberFormat ss:Format="#0.0###"/> (for BIRT v.2.3 - INCORRECT) This superfluous ### produces superfluous digits on the Excel sheet.
