Error message is not refreshed timely.

Created attachment 136255 screenshot description: Error message is not refreshed timely. build id: 2.5.0 v20090519-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New two datasets customers and orders from sample db. 2. New a bar chart, using customers dataset, select country as category and select creditlimit as value. You will see the grouping on category is selected automatically. 3. Switch to Select Chart Type page and select Gantt chart. 4. On Select Data page, disable the grouping on category. Select orderdate as Start Date, requireddate as End Date, customernumber as Task label and status as category. Actual result: There's a error message in chart builder. See attached screenshot. I have checked that there's no aggregation on value series. If you close and reopen the chart builder, the error disappears.
