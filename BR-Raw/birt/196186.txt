Page Break not working in PDF using Page Break Interval set to 1 on a List

The page break is working in the browser viewer correctly, but not in the pdf generated in the following scenario: Create a top level grid Put a nested list in the grid Put a grid in the list and put some data columns in this grid Set the pagebreak interval on the list to 1 and uncheck repeat header Now you if click preview it will show one record per page in the viewer. But if you click on the print (PDF) icon, the pdf does not page break between the records. I have a example rptdesign file that uses the bundled classic database that illustrates the issue at: http://www.reportingguru.com/bugs/pdfbreakbug.rptdesign.txt Note we gave it a .txt extension inorder to avoid security issues with our webserver. This is a critical issue as we have a product release we are working on where this is on the most important report in the bundle. And we are expecting customers to run hundreds of these reports.
