Avoid word wrap on colon in date time column

Build Identifier: 20090619-0625 BIRT supports word wrapping, BUT.... word will be wrapped not only if spaces follows, even if word contains signs like . , : ; and so on. My table cell contains date and time and it looks like 22.01.2009 15: 06:37 I want to get the date on the one line and the time on anoter. Is there a possibility to avoid a wrap on colon and allow it only on spaces? See: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&goto=513834&#msg_513834 Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create Date Time column 2. Put data in this 3. Make the width of the column little bit fewer then data needs 4. See, that time wraps on colon instead of on space
