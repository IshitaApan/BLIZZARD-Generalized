When modifying the X Series Group, Chart API Adds Bad Data Binding

Created attachment 141383 Modified Example Code that Reproduces Error described above Reported to me by customer, verified with Chart Engine API Examples: When a user is working with the Chart Engine API, if the user modifies a grouping on an X Series by using sdX.getGrouping().setEnabled(true); A data binding gets added to the Extended Item Handle that looks something like: Column Binding Name: row[Volume]_Sum Column Binding Expression: dataSetRow["row[Volume]_Sum"] This causes an error when the report containing the chart goes to run stating: SEVERE: Column binding "row[Volume]_Sum" has referred to a data set column "row[Volume]_Sum" which does not exist. This has been verified in several instances. Steps to reproduce: 1: Open the StockReport.Java example Chart API code in the BIRT Source located under the org.eclipse.birt.chart.examples.report.api package. 2: Modify the CreateReport method to startup the Eclipse Platform so this example can run as a standalone example by adding the following lines to the beginning of the method: EngineConfig config = new EngineConfig(); config.setBIRTHome("C:/Libraries/birt-runtime-2_5/birt-runtime-2_5_0/ReportEngine"); 		 try { 	Platform.startup(config); } catch (BirtException e) { 	e.printStackTrace(); } 3: After line 493, where the SeriesDefinition variable sdX is created and added to the XAxisPrimart container, add the following lines: //***** Something funny here. If we add an aggregate expression, it adds a binding to the chart that is totally incorrect 		sdX.getGrouping().setEnabled(true); 		//sdX.getGrouping().setAggregateExpression("Sum"); 		//sdX.getGrouping().setGroupType(DataType.DATE_TIME_LITERAL); 4: Run the example as a Java Application 5: Open the StockAnalysis.rptDesign that is created by the example. 6: Open the second chart. 7: Note the errors "Column Binding "row[Volume]_Sum"..." at the top of the dialog. 7: Open the Select Data Tab 8: Note the Additional Binding in the grid. 9: Click on the Data Binding Button 10: Note the additional malformed data binding. The example code to recreate is attached.
