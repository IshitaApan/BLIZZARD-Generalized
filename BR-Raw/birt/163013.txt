Missing Document Type Definition (DTD) in the DOCTYPE declaration of the HTML output

When executing a BIRT report design to generate the HTML output, the beginning of the output says <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"> According to the http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html link from W3C, a valid DOCTYPE declaration for HTML 4.01 (and beyond) should have a DTD specified at the end of the declaration, such as "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd". The DTD should be generated as part of the output.
