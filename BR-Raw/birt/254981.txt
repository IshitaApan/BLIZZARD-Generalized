Secondary Y-axis format is reset when viewing chart type tab on multiple Y-axis line or area chart

Build ID: M20080911-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a report with a dataset of 10 records and three columns of numbers, sorted by the first column. 2. Create a line or area chart to display this data. X-Axis is the first column from the dataset and Y-axis 1 is the second column and Y-axis 2 is the third column. Size of the chart is 500px high, 900px wide. 3. On the Format tab, go to the "Value (Y) Series - 2" option and change the formatting of the series' marker and line style, width and colour to something different. 4. Click finish to save the chart. 5. Double click on the chart to open the editor. The chart should open on the tab last viewed before closing. If this is NOT the "Select chart type" tab, the preview will show the same format as set before for Y-series 2. 6. Click on the "Select chart type" tab and notice the formatting on Y-series 2 is reset to the default marker, line style, colour and width. More information: Current work around is to click on a tab other than "Select chart type", click cancel to close the chart editor, then double click to open the chart editor again. The "other" tab selected will be displayed and the formatting will be as before. Ctrl-z undoes any formatting that was lost.
