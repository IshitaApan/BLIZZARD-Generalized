String creator = "BIRT Report Engine " + BundleVersionUtil.getBundleVersion( "org.eclipse.birt.report.engine" ) + " using iText " + BundleVersionUtil.getBundleVersion( "com.lowagie.itext" ); doc.addCreator( creator ); The strings could be taken from properties file so that user can provide nl fragment and override them as needed.
