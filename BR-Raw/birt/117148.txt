Support Accessibility

Accessibility support is currently not implemented in BIRT 2.0. There is no out-of the box support for accessibility in SWT and Swing. Applications would create an event handler on data points within the chart or on the axis, or legend, etc. The event handler would receive key events and send textual information to some text reader. In contrast the SVG specification supports accessibility by specifying either a ‘title’ or ‘desc’ element. In the SWT the exploiter must write device specific code in the SVG case the exploiter just needs to provide textual information. Design and investigation work needs to be done to add this support in BIRT 2.0. One idea is to handle accessibility in the same manner as adding custom event handling. Exploiters would provide a call back method for the SWT and Swing renderer when a key is pressed. For the SVG render a textual description would be passed. A new trigger condition would be created to handle Accessibility. For SVG accessibility suppor refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG- 20000802/access.html#AccessibilityAndSVG.
