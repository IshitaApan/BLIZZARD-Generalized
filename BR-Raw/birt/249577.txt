Percentile value in tooltip

Created attachment 114167 Chart with exception thrown There is a problem with putting percentile values in tolltip when chart is build from cube's data. After adding extra binging with aggregation to make percent computation, and putting it into tooltip for series interactivity (onMouseOver) an exception is thrown: exception.unknown.trigger.datatype ( 1 time(s) ) detail : org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.EngineException: The trigger data is invalid or its type is unknown. at org.eclipse.birt.report.engine.executor.ExecutionContext.addException(ExecutionContext.java:1109) I think it would be good idea to put some pre-built expression for percentile values, because even if this bug is fixed, there would be a little work to make percentile under a tooltip. Attached are two reports: One with the problem described above, and second - workaround with additional scripting made by Jason Weathersby
