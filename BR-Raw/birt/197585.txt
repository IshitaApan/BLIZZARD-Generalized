URL Link error in Line-Chart output in PDF format

To reproduce the bug: 1. Create a report 2. Add a chart -> Line chart. 3. Assign four y series to the chart. 4. Go to 'Format Data' tab of the chart properties, select y1 series->interactivity->mouse click->hyperlink->edit base url-> give a url(e.g http://www.eclipse.org) select y2 series->interactivity->mouse click->hyperlink->edit base url-> give a url(e.g http://www.http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/) repeat it for y3 and y4 with different base url 5. After setting interactivity for all four series, click apply and finish. 6. Generate report and view it in PDF format. Generated Output: ---------------- If a data point on y1,y2,y3,y4 line is clicked, url and invoked shown is only eclipse.org and not the corresponding ones assigned to each line series. Expected Output: ---------------- If a data point on y1 line is clicked, url and invoked shown should be eclipse.org as assigned during design. If a data point on y2 line is clicked, url and invoked shown should be birt url as assigned during design. Note: This result is seen only in PDF formats. It works well with HTML output.
