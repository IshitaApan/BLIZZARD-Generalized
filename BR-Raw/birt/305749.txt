Allow a BIRT Chart cell to specify a fill pattern

From: Jason Weathersby Registered: July 2009 Senior Member Barry, This would make a great enhancement request. Can you log it? As a work around you have a couple of options: 1 - use a gradient and define it differently for each series. 2 - use an image. Using this approach you can build your own pattern Just make a small gif with a color and a pattern, and the image will be repeated in the bar.
