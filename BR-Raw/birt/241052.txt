Renaming a chart in a library causes reports to fail without detailed error message

To reproduce: * create library myLibrary.rptlibrary * create chart myChart in myLibrary * create report myReport.rptdesign * include myLibrary in myReport * include myChart in myReport * myReport will display correctly at this moment * rename myChart to yourChart and save myLibrary * preview myReport Result: * the report is rendered, but the chart is missing (showing only the browser's "missing image" red X icon). * Eclipse "Problems" view contains the Error, that myLibrary.myChart was not found * report viewer log contains the warning "Unsupported image type". Expected result: * The error message in the Exclipse "Problems" view is very easy to overlook - the report preview should warn if there are any Errors. * The report engine should provide a more detailed error message than "Unsupported image type" - it is almost impossible to trace the error outside of Eclipse.
