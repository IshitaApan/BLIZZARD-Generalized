Error when preview crosstab with filter condition using cube dimension and its container binding.

Created attachment 138757 test report - preview will fail if you change the filter on crosstab to target as Measure description: Error when preview crosstab with filter condition using cube and its container binding. build id: 2.5.0 v20090610-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New two data sets, customers and orders from the sample db. 2. New a cube with data set orders. customernumber and status as dimension and ordernumber(count) as measure. 3. Insert a table, binding to data set customers. 4. In detail row of table, insert a crosstab. 5. Drag customernumber dimension to column area and status to row area and ordernumber measure to summary area. 6. Add a filter to crosstab. Bind the customernumber dimension of the crosstab to the customernumber binding if the table. Note this time we use target as Group Level. Preview is OK. 7. Now change the filter target to Measure and preview. Actual result: Preview failed. See error log. Test report is attached. More information: I'm not sure why we have to choose target as Measure so that we can filter on cube dimension(other than crosstab dimension). But in this case, if I'd like not to show the customernumber dimension of the crosstab since it is already shown in the table, how should I make it? Or I have productline->productname dimension in the crosstab and I'd like to only display productname in crosstab and use productline to filter.
