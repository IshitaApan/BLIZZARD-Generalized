Image builder - URI and file source type are treated as same

The image item is special item which can access both the global resources and local resources. In the BIRT specification, we can find that the image can access the resources through file or URI expression: Accessing file images: <image id="4"> <property name=”source”>file</property> <expression name="uri">"pict 103.jpg"</expression> </image> Accessing URI images <image id="5"> <property name=”source”>url</property> <expression name="uri">"http://www.google.com/intl/en/images/logo.gif"</expression> </image> Unfortunately, the designer doesn’t distinguish those two kinds of resources. The created report design is: <image id="4"> <expression name="uri">"pict 103.jpg"</expression> </image> <image id="5"> <expression name="uri">"http://www.google.com/intl/en/images/logo.gif"</expression> </image> That means both the local resources and the global resources are specified by the URI expression.
