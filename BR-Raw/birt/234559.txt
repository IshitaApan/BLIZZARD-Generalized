Chart preview is not as expected when its host crosstab has its inner level shown.

Created attachment 102586 screenshot description: Chart preview is not as expected when its host crosstab has its inner level shown. build id: 2.3.0 v20080529-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a cube with a dimension having two levels, like year->quarter. 2. New a crosstab using the cube, having its inner level(eg. quarter) shown. 3. Create a chart view for the crosstab. 4. When defining value sereies, select the data grouped by outter level(eg.year). 5. Preview. Actual result: See screenshot. Duplicate categories are shown. If you hide the inner level in crosstab, the result is correct. Expected result: I think when the user select the outter level, he expected to see the data are grouped by the outter level. So there shouldn't be duplicated categories, it does not make sense.
