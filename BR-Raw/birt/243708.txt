New a report, set its Bidi Layout Orientation to rtl in properties editor. 2. New a label. 3. New a style and set the Bidi text direction of Text Block to ltr. 4. Apply the style to the label.See that the text alignment is to the left. 5. Preview. Expected result: When user sets the text direction to ltr, he expects to read lines from left to right. So text alignment should be to the left. Actual result: When previewed, text alignment changes to the right. This is not expected.
