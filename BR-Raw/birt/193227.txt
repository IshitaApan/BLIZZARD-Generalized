Static Context sensitive help missing from ODA Jdbc and Sampledb Data Source Connection UI Pages

With the introduction of the o.e.datatools.help in the DTP connectivity ui core framework, the existing context-sensitive help of ODA JDBC and SampleDB are missing from the data source connection wizard and property pages. Steps to reproduce: in BIRT Data Explorer, 1) select Data Sources -> New Data Source... 2) in wizard, select the JDBC or Classic Models data source, select Next. 3) In the second wizard page contributed by the oda jdbc or sampledb ui page, select the ? Icon. The "About" section shows up in the Help tray, as expected with the oda page specific content. 4) select "Back" to go to previous page. The About section now automatically updates to the generic text. 5)Then select "Next" to go back to the ODA page, the About section does *not* automatically update. Similar problem exists when creating an ODA JDBC and SampleDB connection profile instance in the DTP Data Source Explorer. See bug 193168 for steps to reproduce.
