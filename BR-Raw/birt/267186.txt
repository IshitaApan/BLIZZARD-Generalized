Unexpected Internal Exception in Edit Data Set - Preview Results

Created attachment 127645 zipped workspace that contains a library and a report demonstrating the error Build ID: M20090211-1700 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create a library 2. Create a data source in the library, e.g. jdbc:classicmodels:sampledb 3. Edit the data source and set Property Binding, e.g. JDBC Driver URL = "jdbc:classicmodels:sampledb" 4. Create a data set in the library, e.g. select * from CLASSICMODELS.CUSTOMERS 5. Save the library 6. Create a report and import the data source and the data set from the library. 7. Right-click on the data set and choose Edit 8. Select "Preview Results" Instead of seeing the results, you get "Unexpected Internal Exception" More information: A library contains a data source using property binding and a data set. Both the data set and the data source are shared into a report. Attempting to edit the data set in the report and going to "Preview Results" gives "Unexpected Internal Exception" Note that Preview Results works if you edit the Data Set in the library, but fails if you edit the linked copy in the report. It doesnt seem to make any difference which property you bind in the data source. If you create a Property Binding for the Query Text in the Data Set in the library, you also get the error when you try and Preview Results for the linked Data Set in the report. I have tested it on Linux and Windows.
