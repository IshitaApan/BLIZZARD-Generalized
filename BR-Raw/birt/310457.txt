AssertionFailed in DataBlock.java:39 due to incorrect check

Build Identifier: BIRT 2.5.2 v20100210-6030 There is an incorrect assert() check in DataBlock.write() at line 39. According to http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&goto=526762 , this error was introduced in 2.5.2 . There is a workaround if you do not enable assertions while running. http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/source/org.eclipse.birt.core/src/org/eclipse/birt/core/archive/compound/v3/DataBlock.java?root=BIRT_Project&view=markup The problem is: assert ( off + len < b.length ); The line should read: assert ( off + len <= b.length ); (e.g. it is OK to insert 4 bytes starting at 0 into a 4-byte b). I'm not sure whether the same problem exists with line 38 as well, I guess it does. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. enable assertion checking by launching java with "-ea" 2. run any(?) report.
