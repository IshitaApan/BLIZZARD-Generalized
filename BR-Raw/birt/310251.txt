Created attachment 165887 screen shot description: Unexpected message shows when change series type after scale min/max is defined. build id: 2.6.0 v20100423-0630 steps to reproduce: 1. New a data set from PAYMENTS table in sample db. 2. Insert a chart, select customernumber as category series and paymentdate as value series. 3. On Format Chart page, select Y axis and set scale min/max as 2004/1/1 and 2005/1/1. 4. Back to Select Data page, select paymentdate as category series and customernumber as value series. Actual result: Message shows the scale value is improper. But there's no scale set when you open the scale dialog. Expected result: There's no such error message since there's no min/max value set observed from UI.
