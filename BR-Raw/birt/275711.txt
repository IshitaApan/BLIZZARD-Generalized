Remove "Report Orientation" choice from New Report dialog

Created attachment 135196 New Report Dialog Screenshot with change highlighted When creating a new report within the BIRT perspective, the New Report dialog includes a "Report Orientation" option for "Left to Right" and and "Right to Left". While I agree that R-to-L and BiDi support is very important for BIRT, this particular choice does not need to be on this dialog. We need to keep the UI as simple as possible for common tasks for the majority of users wherever possible. Promoting this option to this level in the UI does not seem necessary and adds an additional element of complexity for the typical user. Note that the Report Orientation option is clearly visible in the report properties and I think that this is the correct approach. If someone wants to change the orientation then that is the place to do it. Request: Remove the "Report Orientation" option from the New Report dialog
