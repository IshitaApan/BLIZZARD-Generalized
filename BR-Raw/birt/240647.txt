Element hiding in master page header doesn't work

Build ID: I20080617-2000 Steps To Reproduce: 1. Create new empty report 2. Add any element to master page's header area (label) 3. Set visibility property - set hide element for all outputs (Expression: true) 4. Preview report in PDF More information: Other formats (DOC,XLS,HTML) seems to work ok, but when i try to add some scripting to element which should be hidden based on visibility settings, then that script is evaluated even on hidden elements. This causes errors in HTML output.
