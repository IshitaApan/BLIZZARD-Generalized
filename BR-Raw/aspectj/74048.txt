AJDT reports unnecessary compile time warnings for private static aspects

When using private static aspects inside a class (e.g. using the Participant pattern as described in Laddad: AspectJ in Action), the compiler reports a warning about the type never being used, e.g.: The private type RowSet.ConstructorCallControlAspect is never used locally This, of course, only happens when the setting "Window-->Preferences-->Java-- >Compiler-->Unused code-->Unused or unread private members" is set to Warning. These warnings should not be generated as aspects are (almost) never referred to anywhere else in the code, so they are not really unused even if references do not exist.
