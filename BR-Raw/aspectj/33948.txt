inter-type no-arg constructor declaration conflict with compiler-generated constructor

Get error "inter-type declaration from A conflicts with existing member" when declaring a no-arg constructor in an aspect on another type which has no constructors. Likely the compiler is generating a default constructor which collides in the weaver. See test case: tests/bugs/ConstructorDeclaration.java Can the weaver reliably check that a default constructor was generated by the compiler (ours or javac or ...)? Otherwise, this could be a known limitation.
