[inc-compilation] Incremental Compilation Fails for ITD's on Aspects

On my project, when I save an aspect that calls an inter-type declaration defined on itself, the incremental compiler gives a message like this: The method logError(String, Exception) is undefined for the type Foo Foo.java Running a full build clears the error. This might be a compiler bug, or it might be AJDT (I never run command-line incremental compilation, so I don't know :-)). Unfortunately, simple test cases or extracts of just the 2 aspects aren't reproducing the issue, so let me know if you need me to spend some time trying to create a small isolated version of the issue.
