Private members introduced via an interface are visible to the class

If private members are introduced via an interface to classes, the introduced members are visible inside the classes themselves, although the visibility is supposed to be relative to the aspect. Here's a sample: public class Sample { public static void main(String[] args) { Sample s = new Sample(); s.aMethod(); } public void aMethod() { // x is introduced by the following aspect as private // so it should not be accessible here System.out.println("I have " + x); } } aspect SampleAspect { private interface Tag {}; private int Tag.x = 0; declare parents: Sample implements Tag; }
