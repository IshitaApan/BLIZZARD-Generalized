[waiting-on-website-doc-refresh] Typo in org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint String constant symbolic name

Methinks the n_a_m_e of the preinitialization constant is misspelled JoinPoint.PREINTIALIZATION is lacking an "I" between the N and the T JoinPoint.PREINITIALIZATION might be the correct version Note: The value of the constant ("preinitialization") is spelled correctly. Sorry for the inconvenience. Harald
