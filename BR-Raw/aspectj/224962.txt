AjcTask doesn't work with Java6

Although support for Java6 has been added in the last milestone, you can't use it from ant because AjcTask doesn't recognize the "source=1.6" and "target=1.6" parameters. It's easy to fix by modifying AjcTask.java and adding the missing constants: static final String[] TARGET_INPUTS = new String [] { "1.1", "1.2", "1.3", "1.4", "1.5", "1.6" }; static final String[] SOURCE_INPUTS = new String [] { "1.3", "1.4", "1.5", "1.6" }; static final String[] COMPLIANCE_INPUTS = new String [] { "-1.3", "-1.4", "-1.5", "-1.6" }; Thanks.
