problem with Object arrays and clone() with 1.4 .class compatibility

environment - eclipse AspectJ project using jdk 1.42_0 - JDK 'generated .class compatibility' set to 1.4 (under JDK->compiler- >Compliance and class files). I did this because I wanted to use JDK 1.4 assertions. sample project includes one class: package com.test; public class Foo { public void test() { Foo[] array = new Foo[0]; Foo[] arrayClone = (Foo[])array.clone(); } } and one aspect: package com.test; aspect MyAspect { declare warning: call(* *(..)) : 	 "a call within foo"; } When I build this project, I get an error on the Foo java file telling me that it 'can't find com.test.Foo type' with no line numbers. When I change the JDK 'generated .class compatibility' set to 1.3 everything compiles fine..
